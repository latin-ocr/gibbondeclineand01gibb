k--v-„J that authority was at an end which the senate had granted him only

as a personal distindffion3 but his martial widow, disdaining both the
senate and Gallienus, obliged one of the Roman generals, who was sent
against her, to retreat into Europe, with the loss of his army and his
reputation ⁵⁹. Instead of the little passions which so frequently per-

plex a female reign, the steady administration of Zenobia was guided
by the most judieious maxims of policy. If it was expedient to par-
don, (he could calm her resentment: if it was necessary to punish,
{he could impose silence on the voice of pity. Her stri& oeconomy
was accused of avarice 5 yet on every proper occafion she appeared
magnificent and liberal. The neighbouring states of Arabia, Ar-
menia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her alliance.
To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the Euphrates
50 the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the inheritance of her
ancestms, the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt. The emperor
Claudius acknowledged her merit, and was content, that, while he
pursued the Gothic war,fhe should affert the dignity of the empire in
the East ⁶⁰. The conduct, however, of Zenobia, was attended with
some ambiguity ; nor is it unlikely that she had conceived the defign
of erecting an independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with
the popular manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the
courts of Afia, and exacted from her subjeets the same adoration
that was paid to the succeffors of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three
sons ⁶¹ a Latin education, and often shewed them to the troops adorned

with the Imperial purple. For herself she reserved the diadem, with
the splendid but doubtful title of Qeen of the East.
