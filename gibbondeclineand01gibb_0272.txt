254 , THE DsscmNE AND FALL

C {171st P. was discomsited in a great battle, in which the Roman Alexander ap-

x--VQ proved himself an intrepid soldier and a skilful general. The Great
King fied before his valour; an immense booty and the conquest of
Mesopotamia, were the immediate fruits of this signal vie'tory. Such
are the circumstances of this ostentatious and improbable relation,
dietated, as it too plainly appears, by the vanity of the monarch,
adorned by the unblushing servility of his fiatterers‚ and received
without contradidion by a distant and obsequious senate ⁵⁰. Far
from being inclined to believe that the arms of Alexander obtained
any memorable advantage over the Persia-ns, we are induced to suspect,

that all this blaze of imaginary glory was defigned to conceal some
real disgrace.

ffieffsscg’ffrn‘ historiam, who mentions the virtues of Alexander with respe&, and

his faults with candour. He describes the judicious plan which had

were destined to invade Perfia at the same time, and by different
roads. But the operations of the campaign, though wisely con-
certed, were not executed either with ability or success· The first
of these armies, as soon as it had entered the marshy plains of Ba-
bylon, towards the artificial conflux of the Euphrates and the
Tigris⁵ ¹, was encompaffed by the superior numbers, and destroyed

by the arrOWS, of the enemy. The alliance of Chosroes king of
