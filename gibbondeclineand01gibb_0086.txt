THE DECLINE AND FALL

the proportion between gold and filver, as it stood in the time of
Pliny, and as it was fixed in the reign of Constantine, we shall dis-
cover within that period a very considerable increase ¹⁰⁸. There
is not the least reason to suppose that gold was become more scarce;
it is therefore evident that silver was grown more common; that
whatever might be the amount of the Indian and Arabian exports,
they were far from exhausting the wealth of the Roman world;
and that the produce of the mines abundantly supplied the demands

of commerce.
Notwithstanding the propensity of 'mankind to exalt the past,

ancl to depreciate the present, the tranquil and prosperous state of “

the empire was warmly felt, and honestly confeffed, by the pro-
vincials as well as Romans. ‘⁶ They acknowledged that the true
“ principles of social life, laws, agriculture, and science, which had
“ been first invented by the wisdom of Athens, were now firmly
“ establissied by the power of Rome, under whose auspicious
“ influence‚ the fiercest barbarians were united by an equal govern-
“ ment and common language. They affirm, that with the im-
“ provement of arts‚ the human species was vifibly multiplied.
“ They celebrate the increasing splendour of the eines, the beau-
“ tiful face of the country, cultivated and adorned like an im-
“ mense garden; and the long festival of peace, which was en-
“ joyed by so many nations‚ forgetful of their ancient animofities,
“ and delivered from the apprehenfion of future danger ¹⁰⁹.’'
XVhatever suspicions may be suggested by the air of rhetoric and
declamation, which seems to prevail'in these passages, the substance
of thern is perfeffly agreeable to historic truth.
