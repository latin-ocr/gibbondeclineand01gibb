THE DEC'LINE AND FALL

beyond the senses and the experience of mankind, might serve to

Pagans of
Greece and
Rome ;

tude, it might sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding
virtne5 but the faint impreflion which had been received in the
sthools, was soon obliterated by the commcrce and business of
aestive life. We are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent per-
sons who flourished in the age of Cicero, and of the first Caesars,
with their actions, their characters, ,and their motives, to be affured
that their condu& in this life was never regulated by any serious
convicffion of the rewards or punishments of a future state. At the
bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not appre-
hensivc of giving' offence to their hearers, by exposing that doc-
trine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected with
contempt by every man of a liberal edueation and understand-
ing⁵³. 5

Since therefore the most sublime efforts of philosophy can extend
no farther than feebly to point out the delire, the hope, or, at
most, the probability, of a future state, there is nothing, excepta
divine revelation, that can ascertain the existence, and describe
the condition, of the invisible country which is destined to receive
the sonls of men after their separation from the body. BUt.We„
may perceive several deseos inherent to the popular religione. of
Greece and Rome, which rendered them very unequal to so arduous ⁷
a task. 1. The general system of their mythology was unsupported
by any solid proofs; and the wisest among the Pagans had already
disclnimed its usurped authority. 2. The description of the infer-
nal regions had been abandoned torthe fancy of painters and
of poena, who peopled them with so many phantoms and monsters,
who dispensed their rewards and punislimcnts with so little equity‚
