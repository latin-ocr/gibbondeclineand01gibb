temper of Diocletian, who had ylelded a reluerant consent to the
measures of persecution‚ and who was delirous of trying the ex-
periment under his more immediate eye, before he gave way to
the disorders and discontent which it must inevitably occafion in
the distant provinces. At first, indeed, the magistrates were re-

of their churches, resolve to interrupt their religious affemblies,
or to deliver their sacred books to the flames. The pious obstinacy
of Felix, an African biffiop, appears to have embarraffed the sub·
ordinate ministers of the government. The curator of his city sent
him in chains to the proconsul. The proconsul transmitted him to
the Praetorian praefeil: of Italy; and Felix, who disdained even to

of martyrdom3 but there were likewise too many who purchased
an ignominious life, by discovering and-betraying the holy scripture
into the hands of infidels.- A great number even of bishops and
presbyters acquired, by this criminal compliance, the opprobrious
epithet of Traditors‚· and their offence was produffive of much
