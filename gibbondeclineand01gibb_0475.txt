a profound tranquillity during forty years; and the treaty be-
tween the rival monarchies was strictly observed till the death of
Tiridatcs; when a new generation‚ animated with different views
and different paffions‚ succeeded to the government of the world;
and the grandson of Narses undertook a long and memorable war

against the princes of the house of Constantine.

year of his reign, he celebrated that memorable aera, as well as the
success of his arms, by the pomp of a Roman triumph ⁵³³. Maxi-
