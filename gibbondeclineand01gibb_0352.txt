THE DECLINE AND FALL

⁴532
C HXA Ρ· The emperor Gallienus, who had long supported with impatience
a-Qss—-a the censorial severity of his father and colleague, received the in=
acnliiagiffizrni- telligence of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed
{ffflfesslfff‘ indifference. ‘⁶ I knew that my father was a mortal,” said he,
“ and since he has acted as becomes a brave man, I am satisfied.”
Whilst Rome lamented the fate of her sovereign, the savage cold-
ness of his son was extolled by the servile courders, as the perse&
sirmness of a hero and a stoic ¹⁵². It is difficult to paint the light,
the various, the inconstant charaeter of Gallienus, which he dis-
played without constraint‚ as soon as he became sole poffess‘or of the
empire. In every art that he attempted, his lively genius enabled
him to succeed; and as his genius was destitute of judgment, he
attempted every art, except the important ones of war and govern-
ment. He was a master of several curious but useless sciences,
a ready orator, an elegant poet ¹⁵³, a skilful gardener, an excellent
cook, and most contemptible prince- When the great emergencies of
the flate required his presence and attention, he was engaged in con-
versation with the philosopher Plotinus ¹⁵⁴, wasting his tirne in triffing
or licentious pleasures, preparivng his initiation to the Grecian mys-
teries, 01· soliciting a place in the Areopagus of Athens. His profuse
magnificence insulted the general poverty3 the solemn ridicule of his

triumphs impreffed a deeper sense of the public disgrace ¹³⁵. The re-
