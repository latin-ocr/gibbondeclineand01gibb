with the defence of the Danube3 and immediately after his return
from that unfortunate expedition, he invested Licinius with the

vacant purple of Severus, refigning to his immediate command
the provinces of Illyricum ²⁹. The news of his promotion was no
sooner carried into the East, than Maximin, who governed or rather

and discentem, disdained the inferior name of Caesar, and not-
withstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius, exaited,
almost by violence, the equal title of Augustus³⁰. For the first,
and indeed for the last time, the Roman world was administered by
slx emperors. In the West, Constantine and Maxentius affffled to
reverence their father Maximian. In the East, Licinius and
Maximin honoured with more real consideration their benefadtot

war, divided the empire into two great hostile powers; but their
mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity‚ and even a feigned
reconciliati0n‚ till the death of the elder princes, of Maximian,
and more particularly of Galerius, gave a new diredtion to the views
and paffions of their surviving affociates.

When Maximian had reluCtantly abdicated· the empire, the
venal orators of the times applauded his philosophie moderation.
When his ambition excited, or at least encouraged‚ a civil war,
they returned thanks to his generous patriotism, and gently cen-
sured that love of ease and retirement which had withdrawn him
