OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

exceeded the months allotted to the martial reign of Aurelian, we
must confess that a few short intervals of peace were insuflicicnt for
the arduous work of reformation. Even his attempt to restore the
integrity of the coin, was opposed by a formidable insurrcffion.
The emperor’s vexation breaks out in one of his private letters.
“ Surely‚'’ says he, “ the gods have decreed that my life should be
“ a perpetual warfare. A sedition within the walls has just now
“ given birth to a very serious civil war. The workmen of the mint,
“ at the¹ instigation of Feliciffimus, a ssave to whom I had intrusted
“ an employment in the finances‚ have risen in rebellion. They
“ are at length suppreffed ; but seven thousand of my soldiers have
“ been ssain in the contest, of those troops whose ordinary station is
“ in Dacia, and the camps along the Danube ⁸⁸.” Other writers,
who confirm the same fast, add likewise‚ that it happened soon after
Aurelian's triumph; that the decifive engagement was fought on
the Caelian hill ; that the workmen of the mint had adulterated the
coin, and that the emperor restored the public credit, by delivering
out good money in exchange for the bad, which the people was
commanded to bring into the treasury ⁸⁹.

We might content ourselves with relating this extraordinary
transaction, but we cannot diffemble how much in its present form
it appears to us inconfistent and incredible. The debasement of the
coin is indeed well suited to the administration of Gallienus ς nor is
it unlikely that the instrumente of the corruption might dread the
inflexible justice of Aurelian. But the guilt, as well as the profit,
⁴ must have been confined to a few3 nor is it easy to conceive by what
arts they could arm a people whom they had injured, against a mo-
narch whom they had betrayed. We might naturally expest, that
such misereants should have shared the public detestation‚ with the
