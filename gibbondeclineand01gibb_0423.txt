the expectations of Probus were too often disappointed. The
impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill brook the ssow
labours of agriculture. Their unconquerable love of freedom‚
rising against despotism, provoked them into hasty rebellions‚ alike

Mediterranean, indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder,
by frequent descents on the unsuspeffing shores of Asta, Greece, and
Africa. The opulent city of Syracuse, in whose port the navies
of Athens and Carthage had formerly been sunk, was sacked by
a handful of barbariam, who maffacred the greatest part of the
trembling inhabitants. From the issand of Sicily, the Franks pro-
ceeded to the columns of Hercules, trusted themselves to the ocean,
