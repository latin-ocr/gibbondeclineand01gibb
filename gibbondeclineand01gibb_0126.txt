THE DECLINE AND FALL

The Antonines, who valued thel-c virtues, and delighted in their
union, raised them, in the same year, to the consulssiip3 and Marcus
afterwards intrusted to their joint care, the civil administration of
Greeee‚ and a great military command, in which they obtained a
signal victory over the Germans. The kind cruelty of Commodus
united them in death ¹⁶.

The tyrant’s rage, after having lhed the noblest blood of the se-

Whilst Commodus was immersed in blood and luxury, he devolved

adis of extortion‚ and* the forfeited estates of the nobles sacrificed to
his avarice‚ he had accumulated au immense treasure. The Prae-
torian guards were under his immediate command3 and his son,
who already discovered a military genius, was at the head of the
lllyrian legions. Perennis aspired to the empire; or what, in the
eyes of Commodus, amounted to the same crime, he was capable
of aspiring to it, had he not been prevented, surprised, and put to
death. The fall of a minister is a very trifiing incident in the
general history of the empire3 but it was hastened by an extra-
ordinary circumstance, which proved how m-uch the nerves of dis·-
cipline were already relaxed. The legions of Britain, discontented
with the administration of Perennis, formed a deputation of fifteen
hundred sele& men, with instrunions to march to Rome, and lay
their complaints before the emperor. These military petitioners,
by„their own determined behaviour, by infiaming the divisions of
the guards, by exaggerating the strength of the Britilh army, and
by alarming the fears of Commodus, exaeted and obtained the rni-
