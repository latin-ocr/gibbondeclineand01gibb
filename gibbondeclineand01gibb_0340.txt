320 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΗΧΑ P. the western coast of the Euxine, passed before the wide mouths of
Q the Borysthenes, the Niester, and the Danube, and increasing their
fleet by the capture of a great number of fishing barks, they ap-
proached the narrow out-let through which the Euxine sea pours its
waters into the Mediterranean, and divides the continents of Europe
and Asia. The garrison of Chalcedon was encamped near the
temple of Jupiter Urius, on a promontory that commanded the
entrance of the Strait: and, so inconfiderable were the dreaded in-
vafions of the barbarians, that this body of troops surpaffed in num-
{lieffiplqnf ber the Gothic army. But it was in numbers alone that they sur-
ote'l3itliy1ciliii-CS passed it. They deserted with precipitation their advantageous
post, and abandoned the town of Chalcedon, most plentifully storcd
with arms and money, to the discretion of the conquerors. Whilst
they hefitated whether they should prefer the sea or land, Europe
or Asia, for the scene of their hostilities, a perfidious fugitive pointed
out Nicomedia‚·once the capital of the kings of Bithynia, as a
rich and easy conquest. He guided the march, which was only
fixty miles from the camp of Chalcedon ¹¹², directed the refistless

attack‚ and partook of the booty; for the Goths had learned sufficient
policy to reward the traitor‚ whom they detested. Nice, Prusa,
Apaernaea, Cius, cities that had sometimes rivalled, or imitated, the

splendour of Nicomedia, were involved in the same calamity‚ which,
in a few weeks, raged without controul through the whole province
of Bithynia. Three hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the soft
inhabitants of Asta, had abolished the exercise of arms, and removed*

the apprehenfion of danger. The ancient walls were suffered
to moulder away, and all the revenue of the most opulent

cities was reserved for the construction of baths‚ temples, and
theatres .'³.
