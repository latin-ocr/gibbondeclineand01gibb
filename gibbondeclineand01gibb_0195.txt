OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the senate-house, conveyed to the Romans the just but unworthy
resemblance of his person and manners. He was drawn in his
sacerdotal robes of fill< and gold, after the loose flowing fassiion of
the Medes and Phoenieians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara,
his numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gerns of an
inestimable value. His eye—brows were tinged with blaek, and his
cheeks painted with an artificial red and white ⁵¹. The grave sena-
tors confeffed with a figh, that, after having long experienced the

The Sun was worshipped at Emesa, under the nanae of Elaga-
balus⁵², and under the form of a black conical stone, which, as it
was universally believed, had fallen from heaven on that sacred
place. To this protee‘dng deity, Antoninus, not without some
reason, ascribed his elevation to the throne. The display of supersti-

triumph of the god of Emesa over all the religions of the earth,
was the great obje& of his zeal and vanity3 and the appellation of
Elagabalus (for he presumed as pontiff and favourite to adopt that
sacred name) was dearer to him than all the titles of Imperial great·
ness. In a solemn proceffion through the streets of Rome, the way
was strewed with gold dust; the black stone, set in precious gems,
was placed on a charior drawn by six milk-white horses richly ca-
parisoned. The pious emperor held the reins, and supported by his
ministers, moved ssowly backwards‚ that he might perpetually enjoy
the felicity of the divine presence. In a magnificent temple raised
on the Palatine Moum, the sacrifices of the god Elagabalus were cele-
brated with every circumstance of cost and solemnity. The richest.
