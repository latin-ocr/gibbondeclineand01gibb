OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

found thought, and intense application3 but by mistaking the true
obje‘d· of philosophy, their labours contributed much less to improve

= than to corrupt the human understanding. The knowledge that is

suited to our situation and powers, the whole compass of moral, na-
tural, and mathematical science, was neglected by the new Plato-
nists; whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes of

xnetaphyfics‚ attempted to explore the secrets of the invisible world,
and studied to reconcile Aristotle with Plato, on snbjectS of which
both these philosophers were as ignorant as the rest of mankind.

, Consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial meditations‚

their minds were exposed to illulions of fancy. They flattered them-
selves that they poffeffed the secret of disengaging the soul from its
corporeal prison3 claimed a familiar intercourse with daemons and
spirits, and, by a very singular revolution, converted the stndy of phi-
Iosophy into that of magio. The ancient fages had derided the po-
pular superstition3 after disguifing its extravagance by the thin pre-
tence of allegory, the disciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its
'most zealous defenders. As they agreed with the Christians in a few
mysterious points of saith, they attacked the remainder of their theo-
logical system with all the fnry of civil war. The nev»r Platonffls
¹would scarcely deserve a place in the history of science, but in thet of
the chnrch the mention of them will very frequently occur.
