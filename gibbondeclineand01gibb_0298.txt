The unknown symbol of the Earth, covered with a thick vell, was
placed on a cai-riage drawn by cows3 and in this manner, the·
goddess, whose common residence was in the isse of Rugen, visited
several adjacent tribes of her worlhippers. During her progress, the
sound of war was hushed‚ quarrels were suspended, arms laid afide,
and the restless Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings
of peace and harmony ⁶⁵. The trucenf God, so often and so in-
effee‘tually proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an
obvious imitation of this ancient custom ⁶⁶.

But the inflnence of religion was fai· more powerful to inflame,
than to moderate, the fierce paffions of the Germans. Interest and
fanaticism often-prompted its ministers to sanclify the most daring
and the most unjnst enterprises‚ by the approbation of Heaven, and
full affurances of success. The consecrated standards, long revered
in the groves of superstition, were placed in the front of the
battle ⁶⁷3 and the hostile army was devoted with dire execrations
to the gods of war and of thunder ⁶³. In the faith of soldiers (and
such were the Germans) cowardice is the most unpardonable of
sins. A brave man was the worthy favourite of their martial
deities ; the wretch‚ who had lost his ffiield, was alike banished from
the religious and the civil asl‘emblies os his countrymen. Some tribes
of the north seem to have embraced the doctrine of transmigration ⁶⁹,
others imagined a gross paradise of immortal drunkenness ⁷⁰. All
