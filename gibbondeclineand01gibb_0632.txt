THE DECLINE AND FALL

of paganism3 aud that even the conversion of Iberia, of Armenia, or ν
of AEthiopia‚ was not attempted with any degree of success till the
Before that
time, the various accidents of war and commerce might indeed
diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the gospel among the tribes

of Caledonia ¹⁷⁹, and among the borderers of the Rhine‚ the Danube,
and the Euphrates ¹⁸⁰. Beyond the last mentioned river, Edessa was

distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith ¹²⁵¹.
Edessa, the principles of Christianity were easily introduced into the
Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the sueceffors of Artaxerxe83
but they do not appear to have made any deep impreffion on the
minds of the Persians, whose religious system, by the labours of a.
well-disciplined order of priests, had been construeted with much
more art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of Greece and

sceptre was in the hands of an orthodox emperor ¹⁷³.

From

Rome ¹⁸².
From this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of

Christianity, it may perhaps seem probable, that the number of its
proselytes has been exceffively magnified by fear on the one fide,

and by devotion on the other.

¹⁷³ See the fourth century of Mossieim's
History of the Church. Many, though very
confused circumstances, that relate sto the con-
verfion of Iberia and Armenia, may be found
in Moses ofChorene, 1. ii. c. 78—89.

¹79 According to Tertullian, the Christian
faith had penetrated into parts of Britain inac-
ceffible to the Roman arms. About a century
astexwards, Offian, the son of Fingal, issaidto
have disputed, in his extreme old age, with
one of the foreign miffionades, and the dis-
fute is still extant, in verse, and in the Erse
language. See Mr. Macpherson's Disserta-
tion on the AntiquityofOffian⁷s Poenis, p. 10.

¹³² The Goths‚ who ravaged Asia in the
reign of Gallienus, carried away great num-
bers of captives; some of whom were Chris-
tiaris, and became miffionaries. See Tille-

According to the irreproachable .

mont, Memoires Ecclefiast. tom. iv. p. 44.

¹²³¹ The Legend of Abgarus, fabulous as it
is, affords a decifive proof‚ that many years
before Eusebius wrote his history, the greatest
part of the inhabitants of Edessa had embraced
Christianity. Their rivals‚ the citizens of
Carrhae, adhered, on the contrary, to the
cause of Paganism, as late as the fixth cen-
turv.

¹¹³² According to Eardesanes (ap. Euseb.
Praepar. Evangel.) there were some Christians
in Persia before the end ofthe second century.
In the time of Constantine (see his Epistle to
Sapor, tit. l. iv. c. 131) they composed a
flourissiing church. Consult Bmusobre, Hist.
Critique du Manicheisme, tom. i. p. 180. and
the Bibliotheca Orientalis of Affemani.
