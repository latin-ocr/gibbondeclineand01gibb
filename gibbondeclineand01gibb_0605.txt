of the East and of the west, as a primitive and even as a divine
establilhment ¹¹². It is needless to observe, that the pious and hum-
ble presbyters‚ who were first dignified with the episcopal title, could
not poffcss, and would probably have rejeeoed, the power and pomp
which now encircles the tiara of the Roman pontiff, or the mitre
χ of a German prelate. But we may define, in a few words, the
narrow limits of their original jurisdiffi‘rion, which was chiefly of a
spiritual, though in some instances of a temporal‚ nature ¹¹³. It con-
sisted in the administration of the sacraments and discipline of the
church‚ the superintendency of religious ceremonies‚ which imper-
ceptibly increased in number and variety, the consecration of eccle-
siastical ministers, to whom the bishop assigned their respective func-
tions, the management of the public fund, and the determination
of all such differences as the faithful were unwilling to expose be-
fore the tribunal of an idolatrous judge. These powers, during a
{hort period, were exercised according to the advice of the presby-
teral college, and with the consent and approbation of the affembly
of Christians. The primitive bishops> were considered only as the
first of their equals‚ and the honourable servants of a free people.
Whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death, a new pre-
fident was chosen among the presbyters by the suffrage of the whole
congregation, every member of which supposed himself invested

with a sacred and sacerdotal character Ψ. S 1
