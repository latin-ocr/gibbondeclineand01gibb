natural pretensions to the throne of David, might perhaps attrae‘c
the respeel: of the people, and excite thejealousy of the governor3 but
the meanness of their garb, and the fimplicity of their anfivers,
soon convinced hirn that they were neither desirous nor capable of
disturbing the peace of the Roman empire. They frankly confessed
their royal origin, and their near relation to the Meffiah3 but they-

orthodox Greeks, the expedient of bestowing
a second wife on Joseph. The Latius (from
the time of Jerome) improved on that hint,
asserted the perpetual celibacy of joseph, and
justified by many similar examples the new in-
