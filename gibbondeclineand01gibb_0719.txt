fiasts. In consequence of these orders, great numbers of Christians
were released frorn prison, or delivered from the mines. The con-

But this treacherous calm was of {hort duration, nor could the Maximin

pointed out the objects, of persecution. The emperor was devoted
to the worship of the gods, to the study of magic, and to the be-

the favourites of heaven, were frequently raised to the government
of provinces, and admitted into his most secret councils. They

victories to their regular discipline, and that the weakness of poly-
, theism had principally flowed from a want of union and subordi-
nation among the ministers of religion. A system of government.
was therefore instituted, which was evidently copied from the policy
of the church. In all the great cities of the empire, the temples
were repaired and beautified by the order of Maximin3 and the offi-

turn, the supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high-priests
of the province, who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the em-
peror himself. A white robe was the ensign of their dignity3 and
