hesitation or inquiry‚ all that history has recorded, or devotion has
feigned, on the subject of martyrdoms, it must still be acknowledged,
that the Christians, in the course of their intestine diffensions, have
inflietee far greater severities on each other, than they had expe-
rienced from the zeal of infidels. During the ages of ignorance
which followed the subverfion of the Roman empire in the West,
the bishops of the Imperial city extended their dominion over the
laity as well as clergy of the Latin church. The fabric of super-
stition which they had ereaed, and which might long have defied
the feeble efforts of reason, was at length affaulted by a crowd of
daring fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the fixteenth century,
affumed the popular character of reformers. The church of Rome
defended by violence the empire which {he had acquired by fraud ;
a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscrip-
tions, wars, maffacres, and the institution of the holy office. And
as the reformers were animated by the love of civil, as well as of
religious freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interest
with that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the
terrors of spiritual censures. In the Netherlamls alone, more
than one hundred thousand of the subjeets of Chai-les the Fifth are
said to have suffered by the hand of the executioner; and this ex·
traordinary number is attested by Grotius ¹⁸⁵, a man of genius and
learning, who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contend-
ing sedis, and who composed the annals of his own age and country,
