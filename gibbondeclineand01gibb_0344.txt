324- THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HXA P. destroying host returned on board their veffels ; and measuring back

usas—..v their way through the Hellespont and the Bosphorus, ravaged in their
passage the shores of Troy, whose fame, immortalized by Homer,
will probably survive the memory of the Gothic conquests. As
soon as they found themselves in safety within the bason of the
Euxine, they lauded at Anchialus iu Thrace, near the foot of
Mouut Haemus5 and, after all their toils‚ indulged themselves i-n·
the use of those pleasant and salutary hot baths. What remai-ned of
the voyage was a short and easy navigation ¹²⁶. Such was the vari-

may seem difficult to conceive, how the original body of fifteen
thousand warriors could sustain the loffes and divisions of so bold an
adventure. But as their numbers were gradually wasted by the
sword‚ by shipwrecks, and by the influence of a warmr climate,
they were perpetually renewed by troops of banditti and deserters,
who flocked to the standard of plunder, and by a crowd of fugitive·
ssaves, often of German or Sarmatian extrastion, who eagerly seized
the glorious opportunity of freedom and revenge. In these expe-
ditions, the Gothic nation claimed a superior share os honour and
danger; but the tribes that* fought under the Gothic banners, are*
sometimes distinguished and. sometimes confounded in the imperfe&
histories of that age3 and as the barbarian fleets seemed to iffue
from the mouth of the Tanais, the vague but familiar appellation of
Scythians was frequently bestowed on the mixed multitude¹²⁷.

from seven repeated misfortu11es¹²⁸‚ was finally burnt by the Goths
