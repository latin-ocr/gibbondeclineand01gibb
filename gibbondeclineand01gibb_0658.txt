r: Π Α P· ‘⁴ tetis, whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confessione

“ sewn up in the skins of wild beaste‚ and exposed to the fury of

They died in torments, and their torments were embit-

“ were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night.
“ The gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle,
“ which was accompanied with a horse race, and honoured with
‘² the presence of the emperor, who iningled with the populace in
“ the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the Chris-

“ tians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment, but the
“ public abhorrence was changed into commiseration, from the
“ opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed‚ not so much
‘⁶ to the public welfare, as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant³³.’'
Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutione of mankind,
may observe, that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican‚
which were polluted with the blood of the first Christiane, have been
rendered still more famous, by the triumph and by the abuse of the

persecuted religion. On the same spot ³⁴, a temple, which far sur-

paffes the ancient glories of the Capitol, has been fince ereded by

‚ ³² Odia humani generis cenvie‘li. These Clerc (Historia Ecclesiast. p.427.)‚ of Dr.
words may either fignify the hatred of man· Lardner (Testimonies‚ vol. i. p. 345), and

kind towards the Christiam, or the hatred of
the Cliriflians towards mankind. Ihave pre-
ferred the latter sense, as the most agreeable
to the style of Tacitus, ancl to the popular
error, which a precept of the Gospel (See
Lulm, xiv. 26.) had been, perhaps, the in-
nocent occasion. My interpretation is justi-
fied by the authority of Lipfius ; of the lta-
lian, the French and the English transsators
of Tacitum of Mosheim (p. 102.)‚ of Le

of the bilhop of Gloucester (Divine Lega-
tion, vol. u'i. p. 38.). But as the word con-
viai does not unite very happily with the
rest of the sentence, James Gronovius has
preferred the reading of conjunc'li, which is

authorised by the valuable MS. of Florence.
