OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

as it were, into the palacc and the senate, the emperors taught them
to perceive their own strength, and the weakness of the civil go-
vernment; to view the vices of their masters with familiar con-
tempt, and to lay alide that reverential awe, which distance only,
and mystery, can preserve, towards an imaginary power. In the
luxurious idleness of an opulent city, their pride was nourished by
the sense of their irresistible weight; nor was it poflible to conceal
from them, that the person of the sovereign‚ the authority of the
senate, the public treasure, and the seat of empire‚ were all in their
hands. To divert the Praetorian bands from these dangerous reflec-
tions, the firmest and best establissiedprinces were obliged to mix
blandissiments with commands, rewards with punishments, to flatter
their pride, indulge their pleasures, connive at their irregularities,
and to purchase their precarious faith by a liberal donative3 which,
since the elevation of Claudius, was exaered as a legal claim, on the
acceffion of every new emperor ⁶.

The advocates of the guards endeavoured to justify by arguments,
the power which they asserted by arms; and to maintain that, ac-
cording to the purest principles of the constitution, their consent
was effentially necessary in the appointment of an emperor. The
electiori of consuls, of generals, and of magistrates, however it had
been recently usurped by the senate, was the ancient and undoubted
right of the Roman people ⁷. But where was the Roman people to
