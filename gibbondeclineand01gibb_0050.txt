but in the time ofAugustus, the limits of Numidia were contrac'tcd3
and, at least, two thirds of the country acquiesced in the name of
Mauritania, with the epithet of Caesariensis. The genuine Mau- '
mania, or country of the Moors, which, from the ancient city of
Tingi, or Tangier, was distinguished by the appellation of Tingi-
tana, is represented by the modern kingdom of Fez. Saue, on the
Ocean, so infamous at present‘for its piratical depredations, was no-
ticed by the Romans, as the extreme object of their power, and almost
of their geography. A city of their foundation may still be dis-
covered near Mequfflez, the residence of the barbarian whom we
condescend to style the Emperor of Morocco; but it does not appear,
that his more southern dominions, Moroceo itse1f‚ and Segelmeffa,
were ever comprehended within the Roman province. The western
parts of Africa are intersected by the branches of mount Atlas, a
name so idly celebrated by the fancy of poets ⁸⁶3 but which is now
diffused over the immense ocean that rolls between the ancient and
the new continent ³⁷.

‚ Having now finissied the circuit of the Roman empire, we
may observe, that Africa is divided from Spain by a narrow
strait of about twelve miles, through which the Atlantic flows
into the Mediterranean. The columns of Hercules, so famous
among the ancients,' were two mountains which seemed to have been

torn asunder by some convulsion of the element53 and at the foot of

mountain which rears its head into the
clouds, and seems to support the heavens.
The peak of Teneriff, on the contrary, rises
a league and a half above the surface of the
sea, and as it was frequently visited by the

Phoenicians, might engage the notice of the
