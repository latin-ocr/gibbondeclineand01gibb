OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed, before his brother
Florianus shewed himself unworthy to reign, by the hasty usurpation
of the purple, without expecting the approbation of the senate.
The reverence for the Roman constitution, which yet influenced
the camp and the provinces, was sufficiently strong to dispose thern
to censure, but not to provoke them to oppose, the precipitate arn-
bition of Florianus. The discontent would have evaporated in
idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the heroic Probus,
boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate. The contest,
however, was still unequa13 nor could the most able leader, at the
head of the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria, encounter, with
any hopes of vidior-y, the legions of Europe, whose irresistible
strength appeared to support the brother of Tacitus. But the
fortune and anstivity of Probus triumphed over every obstacle.
The hardy veterans of his rival, accustomed to cold climates,
fickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of Cilicia, where the
summer proved remarkably unwholesome. Their numbers were di-
minished by frequent desertion, the paffes of the mountains were
feebly .defended; Tarsus opened its gates, and the soldiers of flo-
rianus, when they had permitted him to eujoy the Imperial title
about three months, delivered the empire from civil war by the easy
sacrifice of a prince whom they despisecl ²⁰.

The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfeffly erased
ι every notion of hereditary right, that the family of an unfortunate
emperor was incapable of exeiting the jealousy of his succeffors.
The children of Tacitus and Florianus were permitted to descend
into a private station, and to mingle with the general mass of the
people. Their poverty indeed became an additional safeguard to
