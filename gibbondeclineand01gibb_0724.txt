Palestine may be considered as the fixteenth part of the Eastern
empire'³³; and since there were some governors, who from a real
or affeciled clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the
blood of the faithful ¹³4, it is reasonable to believe, that the country
which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the fixteenth
part of the martyre who suffered death within the dominions of Ga-

lerius and Maximin5 the whole might consequently amount to about
fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between

the ten years of the persecution, will allow an'annual consumption of

one hundred and fifty mai-tyrs. Allotting the same proportion to

the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the
end of two or three years, the rigour of the penal laws was either
suspended ot· abolished, the multitude of Christiane in the Roman
empire on whom a capital punishment was inflieted by a judicial

the praefec'ture ofthe east contained forty-
