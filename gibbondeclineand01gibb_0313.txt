masters ofa sufficient number of large veffels, with oars ¹³, and the
distance is little more than one hundred miles from Carlscroon to the
nearest ports of Pomerania and Pruffia. Here, at length, we land on
firm and historic ground. At least as early as the Christian aera ¹4,
and as late as the age of the Antonines ¹⁵, the Goths were establissicd
towards the mouth of the Vistula, and in that fertile province where
the commercial cities of Thorn, Elbing, Koningffierg, and Dantzick‚
were long afterwards founded ¹⁶. VVestvvard of the Goths, the
numerous tribes of the Vandals were spread along the banks of the
Oder, and the sea-coast of Pomerania and Mecklenburgh. A strik-

seemed to indicate that the Vandals and the Goths were originally
one great people ¹⁷. The latter appear to have been subdivided
into Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Gepidae ¹³. The distinC’tion among
the Vandals was more strongly marked by the independent names
of Heruli, Burgundians, Lombards, and a variety of other petty
states, many of which, in a future age, expanded themselves into
powerful monarchies.

In the age of the Antonines, the Goths were still seated in
