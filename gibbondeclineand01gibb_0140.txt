was grave and affable. He lived with the virtuous part of the senat-e
(and in a private station, he had been acquainted with the true cha-
racter of each individual), without either pride or jealousy; con-
fidered them as friends and companions, with whom he had shared
the dangers of the tyranny‚ and with whom he wished to enjoy the
security of the present time. He very frequently invited them to
familiar entertainments, the frugality of which was ridiculed by
those, who remembered and regretted the luxurious prodigality of
Commodus ⁴⁹.

To heal, as far as it was possible, the wounds inflieted by the hand
of tyranny, was the pleafing‚ but melancholy‚ task of Pertinax. The
innocent victims, who yet survived, were recalled from exile, re-
leased from prison, and restored to the full poffession of their ho·-
nours and fortunes. The unburied bodies of murdered senators (for
the cruelty of Commodus endeavoured to extend itself beyond death)
were depofited in the sepulchrcs of their ancestors; their memory
was justified3 and every consolation was bestowed on their ruined
and affiicted families⁴ Among these consolations one of the most

grateful was the punishment of the Delators ; the common enemies
of their master, of virtue, and of their country. Yet even in the
inquisition of these legal affaffins, Pertinax proceeded with a steady
temper, which gave every thing to justice, and nothing to popular
prejudice and resentment.

The finances of the state demanded the most vigilant care of the
emperor. Thongh every measure of injustice and extortion had
