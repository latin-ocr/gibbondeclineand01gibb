OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the AIPS, occupy the vacant seat of empire, and oppose his return
with the authority of the senate and the forces of the west. The
ambiguous conduct of Albinus, in not assuming the Imperial title,

left room for negociation. Forgetting, at once, his profeffions of

patriotism, and the jealousy of sovereign power, he accepted the
precarious rank of Caesar, as a reward for his fatal neutrality.
Till the first contest was decided, Severus treated the man whom
he had doomed to destruffion, with every mark of esteem and re-
gard. Even in the letter, in which he announced his victory over
Niger, he styles Albinus the brother of his soul and empire, sends
him'the affectionate salutations of hi's wife Julia‚ and his young
family, and intreats him to preserve the armies and the republic
faithful to their common interest. The meffengers charged with
this letter, were instruaed to accost the Caesar with respeffi't, to de·
fire a private audience, and to plunge their daggers into his
heart⁴⁸. The conspiracy wasdistovered, and the too credulous
Albinus, at length, paffed over to the continent, and prepared for
an unequal contest with his rival, who rushed upon him at the head
of a veteran and victorious army.

The military labours of Severus seem inadequate to the import-
ance of his conquests. Two engagements, the one near the Helles-
pont‚ the other in the narrow defiles of Cilicia, decided the fate
of his Syrian competitor3 and the troops of Europe asserted their
usual ascendant over the effeminate natives of Afra ⁴⁹. The battle
of Lyons, where one hundred and fifty thousand Romans ⁵⁰ were
engaged, was equally fatal to Albinus. The valour of the Britith
army maintained, indeed, a sharp and doubtful contest, with the
hardy discipline of the Illyrian legions. The farne and person of
