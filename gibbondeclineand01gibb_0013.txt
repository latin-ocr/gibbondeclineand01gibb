Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopiscus.
But there is so much perplexity in the titles of the MSS.; and so
many disputes have arisen among the critics (see Fabricius Bibliorh.
Latin. l. iii. c. 6.) concerning their number, their names, and their
respective property, that for the most part Ι have quoted them with-
out distincstion, under the general and well known title of the
