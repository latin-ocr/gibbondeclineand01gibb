the public riches. There occurs, however, a fingle instance in the
first Punic war, in which the senate wisely conneeted this amuse-
ment of the multitude with the interest of the state. A considerable
number of elephante, taken in the defeat of the Carthaginian army,
were driven through the circus by a few ssaves, armed only with
blunt javelins ⁹⁰. The useful spectacle served to impress the Roman
soldier with a just contempt for those unwieldy animals ; and he no
longer dreaded to encountet them in the ranks of war.

The hunting or exhibition of wild beasts, was conducted with a
magnificence suitable to a people who styled themselves the masters
of the world ς nor was the edifice appropriated to that entertain-
ment less expressive of Roman greatness. Posterity admires, and will
long admire, the awful remains of the amphitheatre of Titus, which
so well deserved the epithet of Coloffal ⁹¹. It was a building of an
elliptic figure, five hundred and fixty-four feet in length, and four
hundred and fixty-seven in breadth, founded on fourscore arches,
and rising, with four successive orders of architedmre to the height
of one hundred and forty feet ⁹². The outfide of the edifice
was encrusted with marble, and decorated with statues. The ssopes
of the vast concave, which formed the infide, were filled and sur-
rounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats of mafble likewffe, co—
vered with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease above four-
score thousand spectatores ⁹³. Sixty-four vomitories (for by that name
