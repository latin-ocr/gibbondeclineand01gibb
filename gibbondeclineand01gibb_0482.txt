ment was marked by a broad, and the equestrian by a narrow, band
or stripe of the same honourable colour. The pride, or rather the
policy, of Diocletian, engaged that artful prince to introduce the
stately magnificence of the court of Perfia¹⁰¹. He ventured to
affume the diadem, an ornament detested by the Romans as the
odious enfign of royalty, and the use of which had been considered
