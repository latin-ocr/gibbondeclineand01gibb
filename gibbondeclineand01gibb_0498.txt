sation between the two princes, in which the former discovered
as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed ingratitude and arro-
gance 4. But these obscure anecdotes are sufficiently refuted by an
impartial view of t-he charaCter and condo& of Diocletian. What..
'ever might otherwise have been his intentioris, if he had appre-
hended any danger from the violence of Galerius, his good sense
would have instrueted him to prevent the ignominious contest3 and
as he had held the sceptre with glory‚ he would have resigned it ν
without disgrace.

After the elevation of Constantius and Galerius to the rank of
Augusti, two new Caesars were required to supply their place, and
to complete the system of the Imperial government. Diocletian was
fincerely defu-ons of withdrawing himself from the world3 he cori-
fidered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the sir-mest sup-
·port os his family and of the empire3 and he consented, without re-
·luctance‚ that his successor should assume the merit as well as the
envy of the important nomination. It was fixed without consulting
the interest or inclination of the princes of the West. Each of
them had a son who was arrived at the age of manhood, and who
might have been deemed the most natural candidates for the vacant
honour. But the impotem resentment of Maximian was no longer to
be dreaded; and the moderate Constantius, though he might despise
the dangers, was humanely apprehensive of the calamities of civil war.
The two persons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Caesar, were
much better suited to serve the views of his ambition3 and their prin-
