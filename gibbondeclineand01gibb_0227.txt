OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Imperial tent, and, with many wounds, assaffinated their virtuous
and unsuspeeting prince ⁵. lf we credit another, and indeed a more
probable account, Maximin was invested with the purple by a nu-
inerous detachment, at the distance of several miles from the head-
quarters ; and he trusted for success rather to the secret wishes than
to the public declarations of the great army. Alexander had suffi-
cient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty among his troops; but
their relustant profeffions of fidelity quickly vanished on the ap-
pearance of Maximin, who declared himself the friend and advo-
cate of the military order, and was unanimoussy acknowledged em·

perot· of the Romans by the applauding legions. The son of

Mamaea, betrayed and deserted, withdrew into his tent, defirous at
least to conceal his approaehing fate from the insults of the'multi-
tude. He was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions, the
ministers of death; but, instead of receiving with manl‘y resolution
the inevitable stroke, his unavailing eries and entreaties disgraeed
the last moments of his life, and converted into contempt some
portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortunes must
inspire. His mother Mamaea, whose pride and avarice he loudly
accused as the cause of his ruin, perished with her son. The most
faithful of his friends were sacrifieed to the first fury of the soldiers.
Others were reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper,
and those who experienced the mildest treatment were stripped of their
employments, and ignominioussy driven from the court and army ⁶.
