OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

first care of the new emperor was to deliver the lllyrian provinces
from the intolerable weight of the vinitor-ioue Goths. He consented
·t0 leave in their hands the rich fruits of their invasion, an immense
booty‚ and what was still more disgraceful‚ a great number of pri-
soners of the highest merit and quality. He plentifully supplied
their camp with every conveniency that could affuage their angry
spirits, or facilitate their so much withed-for departure3 and he even
promised to payathern annually a large sum of gold, on condition
they should never afterwards infest the Roman territories by their
incurfions ⁵¹.

In the age of the Scipio& the most opulent kings of the earth,
who courted the protection of the vidtorious commonwealth, were
gratified with such trifling presents as could only derive a value from
the hand that bestowed them ; an ivory chair, a coarse garment of
purple, an inconfiderable piece of plate, or a quantity of copper
coin⁵². After the wealth of nations had centred in Rome, the
emperors displayed their greatness‚ and even their policy, by the
:regular exercise of a steady and moderate liberality towards the allies
⁶of the state. They relieved the povertyof the barbariam, honoured
their merit, and recompensed their fidelity. These voluntary marks
*of bounty were understood to flow not from the fears, but merely
from the generofity or the gratitude of the Romans; and whilst
presente and subfidies were liberally distributed among friends and
suppliants‚ they were sternly refused to such as claimed them as?a
debt⁵³. But this stipulation of an annual payment to a victorious
enemy, appeared without disguise in the light of an ignominious
tribute3 the minds of the Romans were not yet accustomed
