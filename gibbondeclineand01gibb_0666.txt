his λᾶε» were rescinded3 his exiles recalled3 and under the gentle

adm-inistration of Nerva, while the innocent werefrestored to their
rank and fortunes, even the most guilty either obtained pardon or
escaped punishment ⁵⁶.

Il. About ten years afterwards, under the reign of Trajan, the
younger Pliny was intrusted by his friend and master with the
government of Bithynia and Pontus. He soon found himself at
a loss to determine by what rule of justice or of law he should
dire& his conduct in the execution of an office the most repugnant
to his humanity. Pliny had never affisted at anyjudiciat proceedings
against the Christiane, with whose name alone he seems to be ac-
quainted; and'he was totally uninforrned with re‘gard to the nature
of their guilt‚ the method of their eonviffion, and the degree of

their punishment. In this perplexity he had recourse to his usual

expedient, of submitting to the wisdom of Trajan an impartial,
aud in some respects, a favourable‚ account of the new superstition,
requesting the emperor, that he would condescend to resolve his
doubts, and to instruc‘t‘his ignorance ⁵⁷. The life of Pliny had
been employed in the acquisition of learning, and in the business of
