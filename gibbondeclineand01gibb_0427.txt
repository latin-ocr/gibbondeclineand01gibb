OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 407

Pannonia, and two considerable spots are described, which were C ξΞΗΑ P.
entirely dug and planted by military labour ⁵⁹. One of these, known κ--Ψω
under the name of Mount Almo, was situated near Sirmium, the

country where Probus was born, for which he ever retained a

partial affection, and whose gratitude he endeavoured to secure,

by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tra& of marlhy

ground. An army thus employed, constituted perhaps the most use-

ful, as well as the bravest‚ portion of Roman subjects.

bounds of moderation3 nor did Probus himself sufficiently consult

t-he patience and disposition of his fierce legionaries ⁶⁰. The dangers

of the military profeflion seem only to be compensated by a life of
pleasure and idleness3 but if the duties of the soldier are in-
ceffantly aggravated by the labours of the peasant, he will at last

establishment of universal peace, he rhould soon abolish the neceffity

of a standing and mercenary force ⁶¹. The unguarded expreffion

pro‘ved fatal to him. In one of the hottest days of summer, as he

severely urged the unvvholesome labour of draining the marshes of
Sirmium, the soldiers, impatient of fadgue, on a sudden threw·

down their mols, grasped their arms, and broke out into a furious

mutiny. The emperor, conscious of his danger, took refuge in a

lofty tower‚ constructed for the purpose of surveying the progress
