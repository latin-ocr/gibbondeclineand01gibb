HE power of the sword is more senfibly felt in an exten-

slve monarchy, than in a small community. It has been
calculated by the ablest politicians‚ that no state, without being soon
exhausted, can maintain above the hundredth part of its members in
arms and idleness. But although this relative proportion may be
uniform‚ the influence of the army over the rest of the society will
vary according to the degree of its positive strength. The advan-
tag‘es of military science and discipline cannot be exerted, unless a
proper number of soldiers are united into one body, and actuated by
one soul. With a handful of men, such an union would be ineffec-
tual; with an unwieldy host, it would be imprafficable3 and the
powers Of, the machine would be alike destroyed by the extreme
minutencss, or the excessive weight, of its springs. To illustrate
this observation we need only refle&, that there is no superiority of
natural strength, artificial weapons, or acquired skill, which could
enable one man to keep in constant subjection one hundred of his
fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a single town, or a small distrist,
would soon discover that an hundred armed sollowess were a weak
‹lefence against ten thousand peasauts or citis<31153 but an hundred
