was principally displayed on the vifible th‘eatre of the present ¹

world. The petitions which were offered on the altars of Jupiter
or Apollo, expreffed the anxiety of their worffiippers for tempor-al
happiness, a-nd their ignorance or indifference concerning a future
life ⁵⁵. The important truth of the immortality of the soul was

inculcated with* more diligence as well as success in India, in Assyria,

in Egypt, and in Gaul3 and fince wev cannot attribute such a dif- among the

it to the influence of an established priesthood, which employed the
motives of virtue as-the instrument of ambition ⁵⁶.

We might naturally expect, that a principle so effential to re· among the-

ligion, would have been revealed in 'the clearest terms to the chosen
people of Palestine, and that it might fafely have been intrusted
to the hereditary priesthood of Aaron. It is incumbent on us to

⁵4 The xith book of the Odyffey gives a
very dreary and incoherent account of the in-
fernal shades. Pindar‘ and Virgil have em-
bellished the pifture3 but even those poets,
thoughmore cori-eft than their great model,
are guilty of very strange inconsistencies. See
Bayle, Responses au Qestions d'un Provin-

⁵⁵ See the xvith Epistle of the first book of
Horace, the xiiith satire of Juvenal, :ind the
iid Satire of Persius : these popular discourses
express the sentiment and lauguage of the
multitude.

⁵⁶ If we confine ourselves to the Gauls, we
may observe, that they intrusted‚ not only
their lives, but even their money, to the se-

curity of another world. Vetus ille mos Gal-
lorum occurrit (says Valerius Maximus, l. ii'.
c. 6, p. 10.), quos memoria proditur est, pe-
cunias muttum, quse his apud inferos redde-
rentur, dare solitos. The same custom is
more darkly infinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. Ζ.
It is almost needless to add, that the profits
of trade hold a just proportion to the credit
of the merchant, and that the Druids derived
from their holy profeffion n charaeter of re-
sponsibility, which could scarcely be claimed
by any other order of men.
