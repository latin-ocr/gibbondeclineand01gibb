OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

santry ⁷³, which was drawn up in several deep columns, according
to the distinetion os tribes and families. Impatient of fatigue or
delay, these half-armed warriors rushed to battle with dissonant
{houts and disordered ranks3 and sometimes, by the effort of native
valour, prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of
the Roman mercenaries. But as the barbarians poured forth their
whole souls on the first onset, they knew not how to rally or to
retire. A repulse was a sure defeat; and a defeat was most com-

contest was too unequal, till the introduEtion of luxury had ener-

relaxed the discipline, of the Roman armies. The introduetion of
barbarian auxiliaries into those armies, was a measure attended

freedom and ambition. Eight Batavian‘cohortffi renowned in the
Wars of Britain and Italy, repaired to his standard. He introduced
