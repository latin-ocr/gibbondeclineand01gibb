THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {VA P. the third century were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed

Q by the abilities of Cypriam, and adorned by the eloquence of Lac-

tantius. But if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we
must content ourselves with discovering, iu the time of Marcus Ar.-
toninus, the feeble and united congregations ofLyons and Vienna; and
even as late as the reign of Decius, we are affured, that in afew cities
only, Arles, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Limoges‚ Clermont, Tours, and
Paris, some scattered churches were supported by the devotion ofa small
number of Christians ¹⁷³. Silence is indeed very conlistent with de-
votion, but as it is seldom compatible with zeal, we may perceive and
lament the languid state of Christianity in those provinces which had⁴
exchanged the Celtic for the Latin tongue3 fince they did not,
during the three first centuries‚ give birth to a single ecclefiastical
writer. From Gaul, which claimed a just pre-eminence of learning
and authority over all the countries on this fide of the Alps, the
light of the gospel was more faintly refled'red on the remote pro-
vinces οἵ Spain and Britain3 and if we may credit the vehement
affertions of Tertullian, they had already received the first rays of

emperor Severus¹⁷⁴. But the obscure and imperfect origin of the
western churches of Europe has been so negligently recorded, that
if we would relate the time and manner of their foundation, we
must supply the filence of antiquity by those legends which avarice
or superstition long afterwards dietated to the monks in the lazy
gloom of their convents¹⁷⁵. Of these holy romances, that of the
