OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

“ The Bru&e1·i (it is Tacitus who now speaks) were totaily ex-
“ terminated by the neighbouring tribes ⁷⁸, provoked by their inso-
“ lence, allured by the hopes of spoil‚ and perhaps inspired by the
“ tutelar deities of the empire. Above fixty thousand barbarians
“ were destroyed; not by the Roman arms, but in our sight, and
“ for our entertaimnent. May the nations, enemies of Rome, ever
“ preserve this enmity to each other! We have now attained the
“ utmost verge of prosperity ⁷⁹, and have nothing left to demand
“ of Fortune except the disc-ord of the barbarians³³.” These sen-
timeum, less worthy of the humanity than of the patriotism of
Tacitus, express the invariabie maxims of the policy of his coun-
trymen·. They deemed it a much safer expedient to divide than to
combat the barbarians, from whose defeat they could derive nei-
ther honour nor advantage. The money and negociations of Rome
insinuated themselves into the heart of Germany3 and every art of
seduction was used with dignity‚ to conciliate those nations whom
*their proximity to the Rhine or Danube might render the most useful
friends, as well as the most troublesome enemies. Chiefs of renown
and power were fiattered by the most trifling presentS‚ which they
received either as marks of distinetion, or as the instruments of
luxury. In civil dfflenfions, the weaker fastion endeavoured to
strengthen its interest by entering into secret connexions with the
governors of the frontier provinces. Every quarrel among the Ger-
mans was foinented by the intrigues of Rome; and* every plan of
union and public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private
jealousy and interest ⁸¹.

more may be inferred from the principles of
