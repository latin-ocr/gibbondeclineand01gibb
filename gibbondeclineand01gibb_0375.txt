OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

¹⁴ their wealth fhould be collected from the spoil of the enemy, not
“ from the tears of the provincials '⁹.'' A single instance will serve
to display the rigour, and even cruelty‚ of Aurelian. One of the
soldiers had seduced the wife of his host. The guilty wretch was
fastened to two trees forcibly drawn towards each other, and his lim-bs
were torn asunder by their sudden separation. A few such exaniples·
impress'ed a salutary consternation. The punishments ofAurelian were·
terrible; but he had seldom occasion to punish more than once the
same offence. His own conduct gave a sanzffion to his laws, and the
seditious legions dreaded a chief who had learned to obey, and wh0=
was worthy to command.

The death of Claudius had revived the sainting spirit of the Goths..
The troops which guarded the paffes of Mount Haemus, and the banks
of theiDanubQ had been drawn away by the apprehensmn of a
civil war; and it seems probable that the remaining body of the
Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favourable opportunum,
abandoned their settlements of the Ukraine, traversed the rivers,
and swelled With new multitudes thedestroying host of their country-r

had mutually endured and inflieoed during a twenty years war,
the Goths and the· Romans consented to a lasting and‘ beneficial treaty.
It was earnestly solicited by the barbariam, and cheerfully ratified by
the legions, to whose suffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred ‘che>
