{11 (ader os lm'ttff, and were provided with all the inllruntents used
{12 the (10:1221c1‚]222 μί’ sortil‘zed citios. ly their incessant labonr„ a
sacred cdlsxcc, vshiw'r towcred above the Imperial palme, and irad
long exeited tlte indignation and cnvy of the Gentiles, was in a few
ltours levelled with tlze ground ¹³¹.

The next day tlt: aneral ediet- οἵ persecution was published ¹³²3
:and though Dimletiazx, &³1¹ averse to the¹ effufion of blood, had mo-
derated the ser}v of [³ tls-sm, who proposed, that every one refusmg
to offer sacrifico, should immediately be burnt alive, the penalties
inflieted on the obstinacy os the Christiane might be deemed suffi-
ciently rigorous and cffsetml. It was enacTted, that their clmrches,
in all the provinces of the empire, should be de1noli·shed to their
foundation& and the puniihtnent of death was denouneed against
all who should presume to hold any secret affemblies for the pur-
pose os relig-{ons worship. The philosopher-s, who now assumed the
unworthy office of diredfing the blind zeal of persecution, had di-
ligently studied the nature and genius of the Christian religion;
and as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the
faith were supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets,
of the evangeliste, and of the apostles‚ they most probably suggested
the order, that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their
sacred books into the hands of the magistrates; who were com-

manded, under the severest penalties, to burn them in a pnb-
lic and solemn manner. By the same ediC'c, the property os the
church vtae, at once confiscated3 and the several parts os which it
