with the zeal which has always formed the characteristic of the
nation. Their zcal, however, added nothing to its evidence, or
even probability: and it was still necessaiqy that the doetrine of life
and immortality, which had been dietated 'by nature, approved by

divine truth from the authority and example of Christ.

instrueted us not to press too closely the mysterious language of
prophecy and revelati0n3 butas long as, for wife purposes, this error
