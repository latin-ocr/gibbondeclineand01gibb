OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

most Jealous vigilance from the repeated attacks of poison or the
sword. Their rapid journey through Gaul and Italy, during which
they never eat at the same table, or ssept in the same house, dis-
played to the provinces the odious specstacle of fraternal discord.
On their arrival at Rome, they immediately divided the vast ex·
tent of the Imperial palace¹²³. No communication was allowed
between their apartments; the doors and passages were diligently
fortified, and guards posted and relieved with the same strictness as
in a besieged place. The emperors met only in public, in the pre-
sence of their afflieced mother; and each surrounded by a numerous
train of armed followers. Even on these occafions of ceremony,
the diffimulation of courts could ill disguise the rancour of their
hearts 1⁹,

This latent civil war already distra&ed the whole government,
when a scheme was suggested that seemed of mutual benefit to the

hostile brothers. It was proposed, that fince it was impoflible to
reconcile their mindS, they should separate their interest, and divide
the empire between them. The conditions of the treaty were al-

Roma Antica). But we should recolle& that
the opulent senators had almost surrounded
the city with their extensive gardens and sub-
urb palaces, the greatest part of which had
been gradually confiscated by the emperors.

name on the janiculum; and if Caracalla

Esqueline, the rival brothers were separated
from each other by the distance of several
miles; and yet the inter-mediate space was

by bridges thrown over the Tyber and the
streets. But this explanation of Herodian
would require, though it ill desert-es, a par·
ticular diss'ertation, illustrated by a map of
ancient Rome.
