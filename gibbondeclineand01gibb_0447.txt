of government. Notwithstanding the difference of their characters,

the two emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendssxip which

the titles, the one of Jovius‚ the other of Herculius. Whilst the

motion of the world (such was the language of their venal orators)

was maintained by the all-seeing wisdom of Jupiter, the invincible ,

arm of Hercules purged the earth from monsters and tyrants ⁹.

power, and with the inferior title of Casum, to confer on two generals
of approved merit an equal share of the sovereign authority ¹⁰. Ga-

herdsman, and Constantius, who from his pale complexion had
acquired the denomination of Chlorus ¹¹, were the two persons
