THE DECLINE AND FALL

The legions of Galerius exhibited a very melancholy proof of

retreat. They murdered, they ravished, they plundered‚ they
drove away the flocks and herds of the Italians, they burnt the
villages through which they passed, and they endeavoured to
destroy the country, which it had not been in their power to
subdue. During the whole march, Maxentius hung on their rear,
but he very prudently declined a general engagement vvith those
brave and desperate veterans. His father had undertaken a second
journey into Gaul, with the hope of persuading Constantine, who
had affembled an army on the frontier, to join the pursuit and to
complete the victory. But the actions of Constantine were guided
by reason and not by resentment. He perfisted in the wife resolution
of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire, and he no
longer hated Galerius, when that aspiring prince had ceased to be an
object of terror ²⁸.

The mind of Galerius was the most susceptible of the sternet

o paffions, but it was not however incapable of a slncere and Iasting

not unlike his own, seems to have engaged both his affeetion and
esteem. Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period
perhaps of their youth and obscurity. It had been cemented by
the freedom and dangers of a military life-3 they had advanced,
almost by equal stepS, through the succeffive honours of the ser-
vice, and as soon as Galerius was invested with the Imperial
dignity‚ he seems to have conceived the design of raifing his com-
panion to the same rank with himself. During the short period of
his prosperity he considered the rank of Caesar as unworthy of
the age and merit of Licinius, and rather chose to reserve for him
