Christian officers from their employments ; and to authorize the
opinion, that a seen of enthuliasts‚ which avowcd principles so repug-
nant to the public safety‚ must either remain useless, or would soon
become dangerous, subjects of the empirc.

After the success of the Perfian war had raised the hopes and the
reputation of Galerius, he passed a winter with Diocletian in the
palace of Nicomedia; and the fate of Christianity became the obje&

inclined to pursue measures of lenity3 and though he readily con-
sented to exclude the Christians from holding any employments in

the household or the army, he urged in the strongest terms the dan-
ger as well as cruelty of shedding the blood of those deluded fana·-
tics. Galerius at length extorted from him the permiffion of sum-
moning a council, composed of a few persons the most distinguithed
in the civil and military departments of the state. The important
question was agitated in their presence, and those ambitious cour-
tiers eafily discerned‚ that it was incumbent on them to second, by
their eloquence, the importunate violence of the Caesar. It may be

pride, the piety‚ or the fears, of their sovereign in the destruction
of Christianity. Perhaps they represented that the glorious work
of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfecb as long as an
independent people was permitted to subfist and multiply in the
heart of the provinces. The Christians‚ (it might specioussy be

constituted a distinet republiC, which might yet be supprell'ed before
it had acquired any military force: but which was already governed
