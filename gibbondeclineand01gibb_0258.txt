THE DECLINE AND FALL

Ι. During the long servitude of Persia under the Macedonian
and the Parthian yoke‚ the nations of Europe and Afia had rnu-
tually adopted and corrupted each other’s superstitious. The
Arsacides, indeed, praetised the worship os the Magi; but they
disgraced and polluted it with a various mixture of foreign idolatry.
The memory of Zoroaster, the ancient prophet and philosopher of the
Perfians ⁷, was still revered in the East; but the obsolete and mysterious
language, in which the Zendavasta was composed ⁸, openedra field of
dispute to seventy sedis, who varioussy explained the fundamental doc-
trines of their religion, and were all indifferently derided by a crowd
of infidels‚ who rejected the divine miffion and miracles of the pro·
phet. To suppress the idolaters, reunite the schismatum, and confute
the unbelievers, by the infallible deeifion of a general council, the
pious Artaxerxes summoned the Magi from all parts of his dominions.
These priests, who had so long fighed in contempt and obscurity,
obeyed the welcome summons; and on the appointed day appeared,
to the number of about eighty thousand. But as the debates of so
tumultuous an affembly could not have been directed by the authority
os reason, or influenced by the art of policy, the Perfian synod was re-
duced, by succeffive operations, to forty thousand, to four thousand, to
four hundred, to sorry, and at last to seven Magi, the most respested
for their learning and piety. One of these, Erdaviraph‚ a young but ,
holy prelate‚ received from the hands of his brethren‚ three cups of
soporiferous wine. He drank them off, and inst'antly fell into a long
