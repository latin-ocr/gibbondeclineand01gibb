Degeneracy.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

sciences of physic and astronomy were successfully cultivated by the
Greeks; the observations of Ptolemy and the writings of Galen are
studied by those who have improved their discoveries and corrected
their errors3 but if we except the inimitable Lucian, this age of
indolence passed away without having produced a fingle writer of
original genius, or who excelled in the arts of elegant composition.
The authority of Plato and Aristode, of Zeno and Epicurus, still
reigned in the schools5 and their systems, transmitted with blind
deference from one generation of disciples to another, precluded
every generous attempt to exercise the powers, or enlarge the limits‚
of the human mind. The beauties of the poets and orators, instead
of kindling a fire like their own, inspired only cold and servile
imitations: or if any ventured to deviate from those models, they
deviated at the same-time from good sense and propriety. On the
revival of letters, the youthful vigour of the imagination‚ after a
long repose, national emulation, a sle-W religion, new languages,
and a new world, called forth the genius of Europe. But the pro-
vincials of Rome, trained by a uniform artificial foreign education,

were engaged in a very unequal competition with those bold ancients,
who, by expreffing their genuine feelings in their native tongue‚
had already occupied every place of honour. The name of Poet
was almost forgotten; that of Orator was usurped by the sophists.
A cloud of critics, of compilers, of commentators, darkened the face
of learning, and the decline of genius was soon followed by the
corruption of taste.

The sublime Longinus, who in somewhat a later period, and in
the court of a Syrian queen, preserved the spirit of ancient Athens,

Similar establishments were formed in the line betrays his own disappointment and
