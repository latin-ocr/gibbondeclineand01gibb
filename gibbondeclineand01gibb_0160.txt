capital. During the transactiom another detachment had been sent
to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and prevent the hasty
consequences of their despair ³⁸.

The funeral and consecration of Pertinax was next solemnized
with every circumstance of sad magnificence ³⁹. The senate, with
a melancholy pleasure‚ performed the last rites to that excellent
prince, whom they had loved, and still regretted. The concern of
his successor was probably less sincere. He esteemed the virtues of
Pertinax, but those virtues would for ever have confined his ambition
to a private station. Severus pronounced his funeral oration with
studied eloquence, inward satisfaction, and well acted sorrow3 and
by this pious regard to his memory, convinced the credulous mul-
titude that he alone was worthy to supply his place. Senfible‚
however, that arms, not ceremonies, must affert his claim to the
empire‚ ,he left Rome at the erid of thirty days, and, without
suffering himself to be elated by this easy victory, prepared to
encounter his more formidable rivals.

The uneommon abilities and fortune of Severus have induced an

elegant historian to compare him with the first and greatest of the
Caesars 4⁰. The parallel is, at least, imperfect. VVhere shall we

find, in the character of Severus, the commanding superiority of
soul, the generous clemency‚ and the.various genius, which could
reconcile and unite the love of' pleasure, the thirst of knowledge,

and the fire of ambition ⁴¹ ? In one instance only, they may be com-
