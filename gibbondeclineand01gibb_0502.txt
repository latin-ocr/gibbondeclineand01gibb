Constantine¹³. Leaving the palace of Nicomedia in the night, he·
travelled post through Bithynia, Thrace, Dacia, Pannonia, Italyr
and Gaul, and amidst the joyful acclamations of the people, reached⁴
the port of Boulogne, in the very moment when his father was

The Britiffi expedition, and an easy vistory over the barbarians
of Caledonia, were the last exploits of the reign of Constantius.
He ended his life in the Imperial palace of York, fifteen months,

years and a half after he had been prornoted to the-rank of Caesar..
