the Jewilh people3 and although the sum affeffed on the head of
each individual was inconfiderable, the use for which it was defigned,

had so often ssieltered themselves under the [hade of the synagogue,
should now escape this rapacious persecutIOn. Anxious as they were
to avoid the ssightest inseetion of idolatry‚ their conscience forbade
them to contribute to the honour of that daemon who had assumed
