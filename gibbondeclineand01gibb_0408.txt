The reluf’tance of Tacitus, and it might poffibly be sincere, wa‘s
encountercd by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate. Five hun-

had ascended the throne in a very advanced season of life; that the

mind, not the body, a sovereign‚ not a soldier, was the object of
their choice3 and that they expecied from him no more than to
guidc by his wisdom the valour of the legions. These preffing

Tacitus himself. He remiuded the affembly of the evils which
Rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and* capricious
youths, congratulated them ou the elediion of a vErtuous and ex-
