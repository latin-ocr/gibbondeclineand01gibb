Christians.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

and magistrates who presided in the public spectacles were usually
inclined to gratify the inclinations, and to appease the rage, of the
people, by the sacrifice of a few obnoxious vidtims. But the wisdom
of the emperors protested the church from the danger of these
tumultuous clamours and irregular accusations, which they justly
