Q security. A measure so consonant to reason was soon authorized by
the advice and example of the most holy prelates; and seems to
have been censured by few, except by the Montanists‚ who deviated
into heresy by their stri& and obstinate adherence to the rigour of
ancient discipline ¹⁰⁰. II. The provincial governms, whose zeal was

less prevalent than their avarice‚ had countenanced the practice of

selling certificates (or libels as they were called), which attested, that
the persons therein mentioned had complied with the laws, and sa·
crificed to the Roman (leities. By producing these false decla-
ratione„ the opulent and timid Christians were enabled to fi-
lence the malice of an informer, and to reconcile in some mea-
sure their safety with their religion. A ssight pennance atoned
for this profane diffimulation ¹⁰¹. ΙΙΙ. In every persecution there

were great numbers of unworthy Christians‚ who publickly disowned
or renounced the saith which they had profeffed3 and who con-

incense or of offering sacrifices. Some of these apostates had yielded
on the first menace or exhortation of the magistrate3 whilst the
patience of others had been subdued by the length and repetition of
tortures. The affrighted countenances of some betrayed their in-

ward remorse‚ while others advanced with confidence and alacrity
to the altars of the gods ¹⁰². But the difguise, which sear had im·-

this subjeft (see p. 536-544. Edit. Rigalt.)‚
which is filled with the wildest fnnadeism,
and the most incoherent declamation. It is,
however, somewhat remarkable, that Tertul—
lian did not suffer martyr-dom himself.
