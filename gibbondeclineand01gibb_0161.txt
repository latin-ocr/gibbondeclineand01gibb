OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

tiens, and their civil vietor-ies. In less than four years 4², Severus
subdued the riches of the east, and the valour of the west. He
vanquished two competitors of reputation and ability, and defeated
numerous armies, provided with weapons and discipline equal to
his own. In that age, the art of fortification, and the principles of
