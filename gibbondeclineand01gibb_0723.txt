OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

martyrs‚ whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had
been renewed, and whose lost members had miraculoussy been re-
stored, were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every
difficulty, and of filencing every objecstion. The most extravagant
legends, as they conduced to the honour of the chureh, were ap-
plauded by the credulous multitude, countenanced by the power
of the clergy‚ and attested by the suspicions evidence of ecclefiastical
history.

The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment, of pain and
torture, are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an
artful orator, that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact
ofa more distin& and stubborn kind3 the number of persons who
suffered death in consequence of the edicte publissied by Diocletian,
his affociates. and his sueceffors. The recent legendaries record
whole armies and cities, which were at once swept away by the un-
distinguishing rage of persecution. The more antient writers content
themselves with pouring out a liberal effufion of loose and tragical in-
vedfives, without condescending to ascertain the precise number of
those persons who were permitted to seal with their blood their belief
of the gospel. From the history of Eusebius, it may however be col-
lected, that only nine bifflops were punilhed with death3 and we are
affured‚ by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine2.
that no more than ninety-two Christians were entitled to that ho-

nourable appellation¹³². As we are unacquainted with the degree

Egypt, may seem to contradict our moderare
computation 3 but it will only lead us to ad-
mire the artful management of the historian.
Chufing for the scene of the most exquisite

persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in·

insenfibly becomes more cautious and mode-
rate. Instead of. a large, but definite num-r
