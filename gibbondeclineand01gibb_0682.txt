THE DECLINE AND FALL

turbcd the public service of Paganismss, and rushing in crowds round
the tribunal of the magistrates, called upon thern to pronounce and
to inflicl the sentence of the law. The behaviour of the Christians
was too remarkable to escape the notice of the ancient philosophers;
but they seem to have confidered it with much less admiration than

astonishment. Incapable of conceiving the motives which sometimes
transported the fortitude of believers beyond the bounds of prudence
or reason, they treated such an eagerness to die as the strange re-
sult of obstinate despair, of stupid insenfibility‚ or of superstitious
phrenzy ⁹⁵. ‘⁶ Unhappy men,” exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus
to the Christians of Asia, “ unhappy mem if you are thus weany of
“ your lives, is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices ⁹⁶ ?’'
He was extremely cautious (as it is observed by a learned and pious
historiam) of punishing men who had found no accusers but them-
selves, the Imperial laws not having made any provifion for so un-
expeffiled a case: condemning therefore a few, as a warning to their
brethren‚ he dismiffed the multitude with indignation and con-
tempt ⁹⁷. Notwithstanding this real or assedied disdain, the intrepid
constancy of the faithful was produstive of more salutary effeets on

those minds which nature or grace had disposed *for the easy recep· ⁷
tion of religious truth. On these melancholy occasions, there were
many among the Gentiles who pitied, who admired, and who were

converted. The generous enthufiasm was communicated from the

is one of the most celebrated, though not per-

ooth canon of the council of Illiberis refuses
the title of martyrs to those who exposed
themseives to death, by publickly destroying
the idols⁴

'am inclined to ascribe this story to'Antoninus

may have governcd Afia, under the reign of
Trajan.
