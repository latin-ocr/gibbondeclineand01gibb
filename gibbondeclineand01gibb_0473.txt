OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

I. The Aboras, or as it
is called by Xenophon, the Araxes, was fixed as the boundary

barbarians ignorant of the use of letters.

between the two monarchies ⁷⁷.. That river, which rose near the
Tigris, was increased a few miles below Nisibis, by the little stream

of the Mygdonium pass'ed under the walls of Singara, and fell

into the Euphrates at Circefium, a frontier town, which, by the·

care of Diocletian, was very strongly fortified ⁷³. Mesopotamia, the
object of so many wars‚ was ceded to the empire; and the Persians,
by this treaty, renounced all pretenfions to that great province.
II. They relinquished to the Romans five provinces beyond the
Tig'ris⁷⁹. Their situation formed a very useful barrier‚ and* their

natural strength was soon improved by art and military sszill. Four

of these, to the north of the river, were districts of obscure fame

and inconfiderable extent3 Intiline, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Mox-
oene: but on the east of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large
and mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the
Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedorn in
the heart of the despotie monarchies of Asia. The ten thousand
Greeks traversed their country, after a painful march, or rather en-
gagement, of seven days3 and it is confessed by their lcader, in his
incomparable relation of the retreat, that they suffered more froin
the arrows of the Carduchians, than from the power of the great
king ⁸⁰. Their posterity‚ the-Curris, with very little alteration-

⁷⁷ By an error of the geographer Ptolemy,
the pofition of Singara is removed from the
Aboras to the Tigris, which may have pro-
duced the mistake of Peter, in assigning the
latter river sor the boundary‚ instead of the
former. The line of the Roman frontier tra-
versed, but never followed, the course of the
Tigris.

⁷9 Three ofthe provinces, Zabdicene, Ar-
zanene, and canduerre, are allowed on all
sides. But instead of the other two, Peter

(in Evcerpt. Leg. p. 30.) insti-ts Rehimene
and Sophene. I have preferred Ammianus,
(l. xxv. 7.) because it might be proved, that
Sophene was never in the hands of the Per-
sianS, either before the reign of Dioclen-in,
or after that of Jovian. For want of corre&
map5‚ like those of M. Danville, almost all
the rnoderns, with Tillemont and Valesius at
their head, have imagined, that it wne in re-
spect to Persia, and nor to Rome, that the
sive provinces were situate beyond-the Tigris.
