venue of Egypt is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five
hundred talents3 a sum equivalent to more than two millions and
a half of our money, but which was afterwards confiderably im-

afterwards raised both on the lands and on the persons of the inhabit-
ants, when the fertile coast of Africa was reduced into a province ⁹¹.
