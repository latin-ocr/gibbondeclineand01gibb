THE DECLINE AND FALL

appointments of the prcefe& os Egypt, the establishment of the pro-
consul of Africa, and the sure prospe& of the consulship. By his
victories over the Goths, he deserved from the senate the honour of a
statue, and excited the jealous apprehensions of Gallienus. It was
impossible that a soldier could esteern so dissolute a sovereign, nor is it
easy to conceal a just contempt. Some unguarded expressions which
dropt from Claudius, were officioussy transmitted to the royal ear.
The emperor’s answer to an officer of confidence, describes in very
lively colours his own character and that of the times. “ There is not
“ any thing capable of giving me more serious concern, than the in-
“ telligence contained in your last dispatch*; that sorne malicious
“ suggestions have indisposed towards us the mind of our friend and
‘⁶ parent Claudius. As you regard your allegiance, use every means
“ to appease his resentrnent, but conduCt your negociation with se-
“ crecy; let it not reach the knowledge of the Dacian troops; they
‘⁸ are already provoked, and it might inflame their fury. I myself
“ have sent him some presents: be it your care that he accept thern
“ with pleasure. Above all, let him not suspecj’t that Ι am made ac-
“ quainted with his imprudence. The fear of my anger might urge
“ him to desperate counsels ⁵.” The presents which accompanied this
humble epistle, in which the monarch solicited a reconciliation with
his discontented subject, consisted of a considerable sum of money, a
splendid wardrobe‚ and a valuable service of filver and gold plate. By
such arts Gallienus softened the indignation, and dispelled the fears,
of his lllyrian genera13 and, during the remainder of that reign, the
formidable sword of Claudius was always drawn in the cause of a
master whom he despised. At last, indeed, he received from the
