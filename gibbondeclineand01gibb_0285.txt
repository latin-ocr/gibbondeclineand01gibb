OF THE ROMAN EMpiRE. 267

a circular figure, built of rough timber, thatched with straw, and C ἿΧΛ P.
pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke. In the ι--ν--κ
most inclement winter, the'hardy German was satisfied with a scanty

garment made of the {kin of some animal. The nations who dwelt

towards t'he North, clothed themselves in furs; and the women ma-
nufaclured for their own use a coarse kind of linen ²4. The game

of various forts, with which the forests of Germany were plenti-

fully stocked‚ supplied its inhabitants with food and exercise ²³.

Their rnumerous herds of cattle, less remarkable indeed for their

beauty than 'for their utility ²⁶, formed the principa] object of their

wealt'h. A small quantity of corn was the only produce exaCoed

from the earth: the use of orchards or artifieial meadows was un-

known to the Germans; nor can we expe& any improvements in
agriculture from apeople, whose property every year experienced a

general change by a new division of the arable lands, and who, in

that strange operation, <avoided disputes, by suffering a ‘great part of

their territory to lie waste and without tillage ²⁷.

Gold, filver, and iron, were extremely scaree in Germany. Its and ofthe
barbarous inhabitants wanted both skill and patience to investigate “cometam
those rich-vcins of filver‚ which have so liberally rewarded the at-
¹tention of the princes of Brunswick and Saxony. Sweden, which
now supplies-'Europe with iron, was equally ignorant of its own
vriches; and the appearance of the arms of the Germans fixinished
a sufficient proof how little iro-n they were able to bestow on what
they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal. The various
transaffions of peace and war had introduced some Roman coins
(chiefly filver) among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube;
but-‘the more distant tribes were absolutely unaequainted with the
use of money, carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of

commodities, and prized their rude earthcn vessels as of equal value
