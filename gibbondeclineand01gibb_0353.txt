with a careless smile; and fingling out, with affected contempt,
some particular productiori of the lost province, he carelessly asszed,
whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen
from Egypt and Arras cloth from Gaul? There were, however,
a few short moments, in the life of Gallienus, when, exasperated by
some recent injury, he suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier, and
the cruel tyrant; till satiated with blood, or fatigued by resistance,
he insenfibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence of his
charaCter ¹⁵³.

At a tirne when the reins of government were held with so loose
