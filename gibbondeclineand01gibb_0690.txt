THE DECLINE AND FALL

learning was spread over the East. Origen obeyed so flattering an
invitation, and though he could not expedi: to succeed in the con-
verfion of an artful and ambitiouswoman, ssie listened with pleasure
to his eloquent exhortations, and honourably dismiffed him to his
retirement in Palestine ¹¹⁵. The sentiments of Mammaea were adopted
by her son Alexander, and the philosophie devotion of that emperor
was marked by a fingular but injudicious regard for the Christian
religion. In his domestic chapel he placed the statues of Abraham,
of Orpheus, of Apollonius, and of Christ, as an honour justly due
to those respectable fages who had instru&ed mankind in the various
modes of addressing their homage to the supreme and universal
deity ¹¹⁶. A purer saith, as well as worship, was openly profeffed
and praetised among his household. Bishops, perhaps for the first
time, were seen at court; and, after the death of Alexander, when,
the inhumari Maximin discharged his fury on the favourites and ser-
vants of his unfortunate benefa&0r‚ a great number of Christians,
of every rank and of both sexes, were involved in the promiscuous
maffacre, which„ on their account, has improperly received the
name of Persecution ¹¹⁷„

Notwithstanding the cruel disposition of Maximin, the effeets of
his resentment against the Christiane were of a very local and tem-⁷

ronym. de Script. Eccles. e. 54. Mammaea was
styled a holy :ind pious woman, both by the
Christians and the PaganS. From the former,
therefme, it was impossible that she should
deferre that honourable epither.

¹¹⁶¹ See the Augustan History, p. 133. Mo-
{heim (p. q55.) seems to refine too much on
the domestic religion of Alexander. His de—
sign of building a public temple to Christ
(Hist. August. p. 129.), and the objeftion
which was suggested either to him, cr in fi-
milar circumstances to Hadrian, appear to
have no other foundation than an improbable
repert, invented by the Chris-dans, and cre·

duloussy adopted by an histor-ian of the age of
Constantine.

¹¹⁷ Euseb. 1. vi. C. 28. It may be preffimed,
that the success of the Christiane. had exaspe-
rated the increafing bigotry of the Pagans.
Dion Caffius, who composed his history under
the former reign, had most probably intended
for the use of his master those counsels osper-
secution‚ which he ascribes to a better age,
and to the favourite of Augustus. Concern-
ing this oration of Maecenas, or rather of
Dion, Ι may refer to my own unbiaffed opi-
nion (p. 41. Not. 25·)› and to the Abbe de la
Bleterie (Memoires de l’Academie, tom. xxiv.

p. 303. tom. xxv. p. 432).
