THE DECLINE AND FALL

laboured education, by admitting his son, at the age of fourteen‘
or fifteen, to a full participation of the Imperial power. He lived
but four years afterwards; but he lived long enough to repent a

ralh measure, which raised the impetuous youth above the restraint
of reason and authority.

Most of the crimes which disturb the internal peace of society, are
produced by the restraints which the necessary, but unequal laws
of property, have imposed on the appetites of mankind, by confining
to a few the posseffion of those objects that are coveted by many. Of
all our passions and appetites, the love of power is of the most.
imperious and unsociable nature, fince the pride of one man requires
the submiffion of the multitude. In the tumult of civil discord,-
the laws of society lose their force, and their place is seldom sup·
plied by those of humanity. The ardor of contention, the pride of
victory, the despair of success, the memory of past injuries, and
the fear os future dangers, all contribute to inflame the mind, and to
filence the voice of pity. From such motives almost every page of
history has been stained with civil blood; but these motives will
not account for the unprovoked cruelties of Commodus, who had
nothing to with, and every thing to enjoy. The beloved son of
Marcus succeeded to his father, amidst the acclamations of the se-
nate and armies ⁶, and when he ascended the throne, the happy·
youth saw round him neither competitor to remove, nor enemies to
punish. In this calm elevated station, it was surely natural, that he
should prefer the lore of mankind to their detestation, the mild
glories of his five predecessore, to the ignominious fate of Nero and
Domitian.

Yet Commodus was not, as he has been represented, a tiger born
with an insatiate thirst of human blood, and capable, from his

⁶ Commodos, was tlie first Pmflgyregfuetzcs duls date by the years of his life; as if they
