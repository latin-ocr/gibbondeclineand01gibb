blished between the provincial councils, which mutually communi-
cated and approved their respective proceedings; and the catholic
church soon affumed the form, and acquired the strength of a great,
foederative republic ¹¹⁶.

As the legissative authority of the particular churches was insen-
fibly superseded by the use of councils, the bishops obtained ‘by their
alliance a much larges share of executive and arbitrary power3 and
as soon as they vvere eonne&ed by a sense of their common interest,
t'ney were enabled to attack‚ with united vigour, the original rights
of their clergy and people. The prelates of the third century im-
perceptibly changed the language of exhortation into that of com-
mand, scattered the seeds of future usurpatione, and suppIIed by
scripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force
and ofreason. They exalted the unity and power of the church, as
it was represented in the EPISCOPAL oFFmE, of which every biffiop
enjoyed an equal and undivided portion ¹¹⁷. Princes and magistrates,

dominion: it was the episcopal authority alone which was derived
from the deity, and extended itself over this and over another world.

apostles‚ and the myssic substitutes of the high priest of the Mosaic
law. Their exclufive privilege of conferring the sacerdotal charac-

they most carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary con·
descension. The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority
which refided in the affembly of their brethren3 but in the govern-
