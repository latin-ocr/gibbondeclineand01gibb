convincing evidence of guilt ⁹³. The camp of the Praetorians‚
which had so long oppreffed, began to protest, the majesty of Rome3
and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their
power, they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the
authority of the senate. By the prudent measures of Diocletian,
the numbers of the Praetorians were insenfibly reduced, their pri-
vileges abolished ⁹4, and their place supplied by two faithful legions
of Illyricum, who, under the new titles of Jovians and Herculians‚

from the hands of Diocletian and Maximian‚ was inflicted by the in-
evitable operation of their absence. As long as the emperors resided
