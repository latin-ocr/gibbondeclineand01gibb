who fixed‚ in time of peace, their ordinary residence in the pro-
vinces; and their conduct, however it might be suggested by private
motives, was justified by very specious considerations of policy.
The court of the emperor ¹of the West was, for the most part,
established at Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the Alps, ap-
peared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the important
purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of Germany.
Milan soon assumed the splendour of an Imperial city. The houses
are described as numerous and well built; the manners of the
“ people as polished and liberal. A circu-s, a theatre, a mint, a palace,

of Rome was the ambition likevvise of Diocletian, who employed
his leisure‚ and the wealth of the East, in the embellishment of
Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of Europe and Afia, almost

comedia acquired, in the space osa few years, a degree of magnificence
which might appear to have required the labour of ages, and became
inferior only to Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch‚ in extent or popu-

and a considerable portion of it was spent in camps, or in their long
