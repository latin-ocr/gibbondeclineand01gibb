THE DECIINE AND FALL

Qaev-d of SeveruS, the senate was filled with polished and eloquent ssaves

from the eastern provinces, who justified personal flattery by spe-
culative principles of servitude. These new advocates of prerogative
were heard with pleasure by the court, and with patience by the
people, when they inculcated the duty of passive obedience, and
descanted on the inevitable mischiefs of freedom. The lawyers and
the historians concurred in teaching, that the Imperial authority was
held, not by the delegated commiffion, but by the irrevocable resig-
nation of the senate; that the emperor was freed from the restraint
of civil laws, could command by his arbitrary will the lives and for-
tunes of hEs subje&s‚ and might dispose of the empire as of his pri-
vate patrimony ⁷¹. The most eminent of the civil lawyers, and par-
ticularly Papinian‚ Paulus, and Ulpiam flourished under the house
of Severus3 and the Roman jurisprudence having closely united
itself with the system of monarchy, was supposed to have attained
its full maturity and perfee‘tion.

The contemporaries of Severus, in the enjoyment of the peace -and
glory of his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been intro—
duced. Posterity‚ who experienced the fatal effetis of his maxims
and example, justly considered him as the principal author of the de-
cline of the Roman empire.
