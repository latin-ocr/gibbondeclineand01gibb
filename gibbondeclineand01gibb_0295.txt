OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 277

Although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly contributed C ΡΞΧΑ 1‘.
to assvvage the fiercer paffions of human nature, it seems to have κ,- ζ’-ι
been less favourable to the virtue of chaststy, whose most dangerous {gsUsperSebable
enemy is the softness of the mind. The refinements of life cor-
rupt vvhile they polish the intercourse of the sexes. The gross ap-
petite of love becomes most dangerous When it is elevated, or
rather, indeed, disguised by sentimental paffion. The elegance of
dress, of motion, and of manners», give a lustre to beauty‚ and in-
flame the senses through the imagination. Luxurious entertain-
ments, midnight dances, and licentious spefflcles, present at once
temptation and opportunity to female frailty ⁵⁷. From such dangers,
the unpoliihed wives of the barbarians Were secured, by poverty‚
solitude, and the painful cares of a domestic life. The German huts,
open, on every fide, to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a
better safe-guard of conjuga} fidelity, than the vvalls, the bolts, and
the eunuchs of a Perfian haram. To this reason, another may be
added of a more honourable nature. The Germans treated their
women With esteem and confide-nce, consulted them on every occa-
sion of importance‚ and fondly believed, that in their breasts re-
fided a sanCtity and wisdom, more than human. Some of these
interpreters of fate, such as Velleda, in the Batavian war, governed
in the name of the deity, the fiercest nations of Germany 5⁸. The
rest of the sex, without being adored as goddesses, vvere respected as
t-he free and equal companions of soldiers; associated even by the
marriage ceremony to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory ⁵⁹. In
their great invasione„ the camps of the barbarians vvere filled with

a multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst
