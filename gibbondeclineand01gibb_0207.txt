OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

tou-ncils every scheme of reformation was imputed. Some trifling
accident blew up their discontent into a furbus mutiny3 and a
civil war raged, during three days, in Rome, whilst the life of that
excellent minister was defended by the grateful people. Terrified,
at length, by the sight of some houses in flames, and by the threats
of a general conflagration, the people yielded with a ligh, and left
the virtuous, but unfortunate, Ulpian to his fate. He was pursued
into the Imperial palace, and maffacred at the feet of his master,
who vainly strove to cover him with the purple, and to obtain his
pardon from the inexorable soldiers. Such was the deplorable
weakness of government, that the emperor was unable to revenge
his murdered friend and his insulted dignity, without stooping to>
the arts of patience and diffimulation. Epaga-thus, the principat
leader of the mutiny, was removed from Rome, by the honourable
employment of praefedl: of Egypt; from that high ran-k he was
gently degraded to the government of Crete; and when, at length,
his popularity among the guards was effaced by time and ab-

commanded the Pannonian legions with the spirit of ancient dis-
cipline. Their brethren of Rome, embracing the common cause of
military lieense‚ demanded the head of the reformer. Alexander,
however, instead of yielding to their seditious clamonrs, shewed a:
just sense of his merit and services, by appointing him his colleague
