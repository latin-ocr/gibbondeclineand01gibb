THE DECLINE AND FALL

with too little regard to the laws of society, or even to those of
love ⁴³. He was ssain at Cologne, by a conspiracy of jealous hus-
bauds, whose revenge would have appeared more justifiable, had
they spared the innocence of his son. After the murder of so many
valiant princes, it is somewhat remarkable, that a female for a long
time controlled the fierce legions of Gaul, and still more singular,
that she was the mother of the unfortunate Victorinus. The
arts and treasures of Victoria enabled her succeffively to place
Marius and Tetricus on the throne, and to reign with a manly

manner, betrayed his own counsels to the enemy, and with a few
