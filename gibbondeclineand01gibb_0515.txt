oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

An incurfion of the Franks had summoned >Constantium with a

part of his army, to the banks of the Rhine ; the r‘emaifnder of

the troops were stationed in the southern provinces of Gaul, which
lay exposed to the enterprises of the Ital-ian emperor5and a con-
flderable treasure was depofited in the city of Arles. Maximian
either craftily invented, or hastily credited, a vain report of the
death of Constantine. Without hesitation he Ἴειΐεέηᾱεά the throne,
feized the treasure, and scattering it with his accustomed profufion
among the soldiers, endeavoured to awake in their minds the

memory of his ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could>

establish his authority, or finish the negociation which he appears
to have entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of Con-
stantine defeated all his hopes, On the first news of his perfidy and
ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine to

the Saone, embarked onvthe last mentioned river at Chalons,
and at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone, arrived

at “the gates of Ades, with a military force which it was im-
poffible for Maximian to refist, and which scarcely permitted him to
take refuge in the neighbouring city of Marseilles. The narrow neck
of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against
the besiegers, whilst the sea was open, either for the escape of
Maximian, or for the succours of Maxentius, if the latter should
chuse to disguise his invasion of Gaul, under the honourable
pretence of defending a distreffed, or, as he might allege, an
injur-ed father. Apprehenfive of the fatal consequences of delay‚
Constantine gave orders for an immediate affault5 but the scaling
ladders were found too short for the height of the walls, and
Marseilles might have sustained aa long a siege as· it formerly (lid
against the arms of Caesar, if the garrison, conscious either of their
fault or of their danger, had not purchased their pardon by de-
livering up the city and the person of Maximian. A secret but
irrevocable sentence of death was pronounced against the usurper,
