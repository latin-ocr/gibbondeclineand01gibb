position of human nature3 and they supposed that any popular modc k-—-*r———-·'

of saith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the
senses, would, in proportion as it receded from superstition, sind
itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and thc
visions of fanaticism. The careless glance which men of wit and
learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation, ser-ved only
to confirm their hasty opinion, and to persuade them, that the prin-
ciple, which they might have revered, of the divine unity, was de-
faced by the wild enthufiasm, and annihilated by the airy specula-
tions, of the new sectaries. The author of a celebrated dialogue‚
which has been attributed to Lucian, whilst he affecta to treat the
mysterious subjeci: of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and con-
tempt, betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human
reason, and of the inscrutable nature of the Divine perfections ¹¹.

It might appear less surprismg, that the founder of Christ-
ianity should not only be revered by‘his disciples as a fage and
a prophet, but that he should be adored as a God. The Po-
lytheists were disposed to adopt every article of saith, which seemed
to offer any resemblance, however distant or imperfect, with the

popular mythology3 and the legende of Bacchus, of Hercules, and ’

of AEsculapius, had, in some measure, prepared their iniagination
for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form¹².
