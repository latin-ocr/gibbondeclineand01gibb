390 THE DEeLmE ΛΝΒ FALL

C {issip' Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to all the principal

«Τῇ-ὴ) cities of the empire, Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica, Corinth,
faites-‹diiii- Athens, Antioeh, Alexandria, and Carthage, to claim their obe-

appointed; nor, indeed, was it possible, that the armies and the
provinces ssrOuld long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of
Rome. On the ssightest touch, the unsupported fabric of their
pride and power fell to the ground. The expiring senate displayed
a sudden lustre, blazed for a moment, and was extinguished for
ever.
