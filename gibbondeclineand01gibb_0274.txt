The reign of Artaxerxes, which from the last defeat of the Par-
thians lasted only fourteen years, forms a memorable aera in the
history of the East, and even in that of Rome. His character seems
to have been marked by those bold and commanding features, that
generally dissinguish the princes who conquer, from those who
inherit, an empire. Till the last period of the Perfian monarchy,
his code of laws was respe8oed as the ground-work of their civil and
religious policy⁵⁴. Several of his sayings are preserved. One of
them in particular discovers a deep insight into the constitution of
government. “ The authority of the prince,'' said Artaxerxes, “ must
“ be defended by a military force3 that force can only be main-
“ tained by taxes; all taxes must, at last, fall upon agriculture; and
“ agriculture can never flourissi except under the prote&ion of
“ justice and moderatiori ⁵⁵.” Artaxerxes bequeathed his new em-
pire, and his ambitious defigns against the Romans, to Sapor, a son
not unworthy of his great father; but those defigns were too
extensive for the power of Perfia, and served only to involve both
nations in a long series of destruetive wars and reciprocal calamities.

The Perilaus, long since civilized and corrupted, were very far
from poffeffing the martial independence, and the intrepid hardi-
ness, both of mind and body, which have rendered the northern
barbarians masters of the world. The science of war, that con-
stituted the more rational force of Greece and Rome, as it now does
of Europe, never made any considerable progress in the East. Those
