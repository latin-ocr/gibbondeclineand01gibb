THE DECLINE AND FALL

ι-Ν highways‚ against the impending invasion of Maximin. A number

of depudes, chosen from the most illustrious of the senatorian and
equestrian orders, were dispatched at the same time to the governor
of the several provinces, earnestly conjuring them to fly to the
affistance of their country, and to remind the nations of their
ancient ties of friendship with the Roman senate and people. The
general respect with which these deputies awere received, and the
zeal of Italy and the provinces in favour of the senate, sufficiently
prove that the subje&s of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon
distress, in which the body of the people has more to fear from
oppreffion than from refistance. The consciousness of that melan-
choly truth‚ inspires a degree of persevering fury, seldom to be
found in those civil wars which are artificially supported for the be-
nefit of a few fadfious and defigning leaders ²⁵.

But while the cause of the Gordians was embraced with such

or i-e diffufive ardour, the Gordians themselves were no more. The
2 7· feeble court of Carthage was alarmed with the rapid approach of

Capelianus, governor of Mauritania, who, with a small band of
Veterans‚ and a fierce host of barbariam, attacked a faithful, but
unwarlike province. The younger Gordian sallied out to meet the
enemy at the head of a few guards, and a numerous undisciplined
multitude, educated in the peaceful luxury of Carthage. His use-
less valour served only to procure him an honourable death, in the
field of battle. His aged father, whose reign had not exceeded

thirty—fix days, put an end to his life on the first news of the de-
feat. Carthage, destitute of defence‚ opened her gates to the con-

queror, and Africa was exposed to- the rapacious cruelty of a ssave,-

obliged to satisfy his unrelenting master with a large account of
blood and treasure ²⁶.
