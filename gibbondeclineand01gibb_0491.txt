we may infer from the greatness of the work, how long he had k--v——J
meditated his defign of abdicating the cmpire. The choice of a
spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to
luxury, did not require the partiality of a native. “ The soil was

“ Istria and some parts of Italy are exposed.

“ the palace are no less beautiful than the soil and climate was in-

“ along the Hadriane, in which a number of small issands are·
“ scattered in such a manner, as to give this part of the sea the
“ appearance of a great lake. On the north fide lies the bay,
“ which led to the ancient city of Salona; and the country be-
“ yond it, appearing in sight, forms a proper contrast to that
“ more extensive prospe& of water, which the Hadriatic presents
“ both to the south and to the east. Tovvards the north, the view
“ is terminated by high and irregular mountains, fituated at a

“ proper distance, and, in many places, covered with villages,
“ woods, and vineyards¹¹⁷.'’
