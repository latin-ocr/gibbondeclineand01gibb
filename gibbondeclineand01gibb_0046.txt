THE DECLI'NE AND FALL

nions of the House of Austria were compriscd within the limits of

the Roman empire.

Dalmatia, to which the name of Illyricum more properly belonged,
was a long, but narrow tract, between the Save and the Adriatic.
The best part of the sea-coast, which still retains its ancient ap-
pellation, is a province of the Venetian state, and the seat of the
little republic of Ragusa. The inland parts have assumed the Sela-.-
vonian names of Croatia and Bosnia ; the former obeys an Austrian
governor, the latter a Turkissi patha 3 but the whole country is still
infested by tribes of barbarians, whose savage independence irregu-
larly marks the doubtful limit of the Christian and Mahometan
power ⁸⁰.

After the Danube had received the waters of the Teyss and the.
Save, it acquired, at least, among the Greeks, the name of 1ster⁸¹.
It formerly divided Maefia and Dacia, the latter of which, as we
have already seen, was a conquest of Trajan, and the only pro-'
vince beyond the river. If we inquire into the present state of those
comunes, we shall find that, on the left hand of the Danube, Temes-
war and Transylvania have been annexed‚ after many revolutions,
to the crown of Hungary3 whilst the principalities of Moldavia and
&Valachia acknowledge the supremacy of the Ottoman Porte. *On
the right'hand of the Danube, Maefia, which, during the middle
ages, was broken into the barbarian kingdoms of Servia and Bul-
gana, is again united in Turkish ssavery. ⁷

The appellation of Roumelia, which is still bestowed by the
Turks on the extensive countries of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece,
preserves the memory of their ancient state under the Roman
empire. In the time ofthe Antonines‚ the martial regions ofThraee‚.

Εὖ Α Venetian “avellem the Abbate from the munificence of the emperor, its
Fortis, has lately given us some ac· sovereign.
count of those very obscure countries. ⁸¹ The Save rises near the confines of ssria,
Eut the geography and antiquities of the and was confidered by the more early Greeks
western Illyricum can be expected only as the principal stream of the Danube.
