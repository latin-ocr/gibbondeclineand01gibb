him. Without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the
British army, Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague‚
as the sovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps3 but he gave
him only the title of Caesar, and the fourth rank among the Roman
prince5‚ whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his)
favourite Severus. The apparent harmony of the empire was still,
preserved, and Constantine, who already.⁴poffeffed the substance,
expected, without impatience, an opportunity of obtaining the ho-
nours, of supreme power ¹⁷.

The children of Constantius by his second marriage were fix in
number, three of either sex, and whose Imperial descent might
have solicited a preference over the meaner extraction of the son of
Helena. But Constantine was in the thirty-second year of his age‚.
in the full vigour both of mind and body, at the time when the
eldest of his brothers could not poffibly be more than thirteen years- “
old. His claim of superior merit had been allowed and ratified by

the dying emperor ¹⁵³. In his last moments, Constantius bequeathed
to his eldest son the care of the safety as well as greatness of the fa·

mily3 conjuring him to affume both ⁵the authority and the senti-2
ments of a father with regard to the children of Theodora. Their:
liberal education‚ advantageous marriages, the secure dignity of their
lives, and the first honours of the state with which they were in.-
vested, attest the fraternal affection of Constantine3. and as those.
princes poffefl'ed a mild and grateful dispofition, they submittedwitm
out reluctance to the superiority of his genius and fortune ¹⁹.

father, which is warranted by reason, aad in-
matred by Eumenius, seems to be confirmed
