O‘F THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

an independent and increafing state in the heart of the Roman
empire.

Ι. We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient
world, and the facility with which the most different and even hos-
tile nations embraced, or at least respected‚ each othcr's superstitious.
A single people refused to join in the common intercourse of man-
kind. The Jews, who, under the Assyriam and Persian monarchies,
had languished for many ages the most despised portion of their
ssaves ¹, emerged from obscurity under the succeffors of Alexander;
and as they multiplied to a surprising degree in the East, and after—
wards in the West, they soon excited the curiosity and wonder
of other nations ². The sullen obstinacy with which they main-
tained their peculial· ritcs and unsocial manners, seemed to mark
them out a distinet species of men, who boldly profeffed, or who
faintly disguised, their implacable hatred to the rest of human-kind ³.
Neither the violence of Antiochus, nor the arts of Herod, nor the
example of the circumjacent natione, could ever persuade the Jews
to affociate with the institutions of Moses the elegant mythology
of the Greeks ⁴.

the Romans protected a superstition which they despised ³.

The letter of this law is not to be found in,

selves in a sort of occafional confoimity, de-
rived from Herod, by whose example and
authority they had been seduced, the name
of Herodians. But their numbers were so in-
coniiderable, and their duration so short, that
josephus has not thought them worthy of hi»
