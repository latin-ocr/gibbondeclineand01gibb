OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

of the prophet, and the vicegerent of Heaven; that patience was
the first virtue of a Muffissmm, and unlimited obedience the great
duty os a subject.

The minds of the Romans were very differently prepared for
ssavery. Oppreffed beneath the weight of their own corruption
and of military violence, they for a long while preserved the sen-
timents, or at least the ideas, of their freeborn ancestors. The
education of Helvidius and Thrasea, of Tacitus and Pliny, was the
same as that of Cato and Cicero. From Grecian philosophy, they
had imbibed the justest and most liberal notions of the dignity of
human nature, and the origin of civil society. The history of their
own country had taught them to revere a free, a virtuous, and a
victorious commonwealth; to abhor the successful crimes of Caesar
and Augustus3 and inwardly to despise those tyrants whom they
adored with the most abjecit fiattery. As magistrates and senators,
they were admitted into the great couneil, which had once dietated
laws to the earth, whose name still gave a sanction to the adis of
the monarch, and whose authority was so often prostituted to the
vilest purposes of tyranny. Tiberius, aud those emperors who
adopted his maxims, attempted to disguise their murders by the
formalities of justice, and perhaps enjoyed a secret pleasure in reu-
dering the senate their accomplice, as well as their vic‘tim. By
this assembly, the last of the Romans were condemned for ima-
ginary crimes and real virtues. Their infamous accusers assumed
the language of independent patriots, who arraigned a dangerous
citizen before the tribunal of his country; and the public service

was rewarded by riches and honours ⁵⁵. The servile judges profell'ed
