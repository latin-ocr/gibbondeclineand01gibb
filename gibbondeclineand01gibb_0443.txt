AS the reign of Diocletian was more illustrious thanthat of any
⁴ of‘his' predecefl'ors, so was his birth more abjee‘c and obscure.
,The strong claims of merit and of violence had frequently· superseded
the ideal prerogatives of nobility3 but a distinet line of separation
was hitherto preserved between the free and the servile part of man-
kind. Theparents of Diocletian had been ssaves in the house of Anu-
linus, aRoman senator; nor was he himself distinguished by any other

’ name, than that which he derived from a small town in Dalmatia,

from whence his mother deduced her origin ¹. It is, however, pro-
bable, that his father obtained the freedom of the family, and that
he soon acquired an office of scribe, which was commonly exercised
by persons of his condition ². Favourable oracles, or rather the
consciousness of superiour merit, prompted his aspiring son to
pursue the profeffion of arms and the hopes of fortune3 and

and accidente which enabled him in the end to fulfil those oracles,
