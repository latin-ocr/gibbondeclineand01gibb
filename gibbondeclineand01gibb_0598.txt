he would have lived for ever in a state of virgin purity, and that
some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise
with a race of innocent and immortal beings⁹¹. The use of mar-
riage was permitted only to his fallen posterity, as a necessary ex-
pedient to continue the human species, and as a restraint, however
imperfe&‚ on the natural licentiousness of desire. The hesitation
of the orthodox⁶casuists on this interesting subjeer, betrays the per-
plexity of men, unwilling to approve an institution, which they were
compelled to tolerate ⁹². The enumeration of the very whimfical
laws, which they most circumstantially imposed on the marriage-
bed, would force a smile from the young, and a bluss1 from the
fair. It was their unanimous sentiment, that a first marriage was·
adequate to all the purposes of nature and of society. The'sen‘suat
connexion was refined into a resemblance of the mystic union of‘
Christ with his church‚ and was pronounced to be indiffoluble
either by divorce or by death. The practice of second nuptials
was branded with the name of a legal adultery3 and the persons who*
were guilty of so scandalous an offence against Christian purity,¹
were soon excluded from the honours, and even from the alms, of
the church ⁹³. Since defire was imputed as a crime, and marriage
was tolerated as a desedit, it was conflstent with the same principles
to consrder a state of celibacy as the nearest approach to the Divine
