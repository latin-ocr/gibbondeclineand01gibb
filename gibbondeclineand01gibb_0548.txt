523 THE DECLINEAND FALL

C Ιξκλ P· In this exalted state of glory it was impoffible that Constantine
’,ζ-μζ] should any longer endure a partner in the empire. Confiding in the
Ξζῖοζὲῑζᾟ superiority of his genius and military power, he determined, with-
ζζῗέῗῗᾙξξς, out any previous inj ury, to exert them for the destruction of Licinius,
A.D. 3²3- whose advaneed age and unpopular vices seemed to¹ offer a very

troops of Constantine were ordered to rendezvous at Theffalonica;

they amounted to above an hundred and twenty thousand horse

and foot ¹⁰⁴. Their emperor was satisfied with their martial ap-
