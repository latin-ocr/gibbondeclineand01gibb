and pro'fession its patron, whose attributes, in the most distant ages
and countrieS, were uniformly derived from the charaeter of their
peculiar votaries. A republic of gods of such opposite tempers and
interest required, in every system, the moderating hand of a su·-
preme magistrate, who, by the progress of knowledge and flattery,
was gradually invested with the sublime perfectioris of an Eternal
Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch⁴. Such was the mild spirit
of antiquity‚ that the nations were less attentive to the difference3
than to the resemblance, of their religious worship. The Greek, the
Roman, and the Barbarian, as they met before their respeefive altars,
easily persuaded themselves, that under various names, and with
various ceremonies‚ they adored the same deities. The elegant

mythology of Homer gave a beautiful, and almost a regular form,
to the polytheism of the ancient world ⁵.

The philosophers of Greece deduced their morals from the nature
of man, rather than from that of God. They meditated, however,
on the Divine Nature, as a very curious and important speculation,
and in the‘profound inquiry, they displayed the strength and weak-
ness of the human understanding ⁶. Of the four most celebrated
schools, the Stoics and the Platonists endeavoured to reconcile the
jarring interests of reason and piety. They have left us the most
sublime proofs of the existence and perfeetions of the first cause ; but,
as it was impossible for them to conceive the creation of matter, the
workman in the Stoic philosophy was not sufficiendy distinguished
from the work3 whilst, on the contrary, the spiritual God of Plato
