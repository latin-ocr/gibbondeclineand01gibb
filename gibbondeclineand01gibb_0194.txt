During the twenty days that- elapsed from the declaration to the vic-
tory of Antoninus (for in so {hort an interval was the fate of the Ro-

man world decided), the capital and the provinces, more especially
those of the East, were distraeted with hopes and fears, agitated with

· tumult, and- steined with a useless effufion of civil blood, smee who-
* soever of the rivals prevailed in Syria, must reign over the empire.

The specious letters in which the young conqueror announced h-is
ινὶξὶοιὙ to the obedient senate, ‹were filled with profeffions of virtue

rand moderation; the shining examples of Marcus and Augustus, he

he affeGed to dwell with pride on the striking resemblance of
his own age and fortunes with those of Augustis& who in the

*earliest youth had revenged by a successful war the murder of his
father. By adopting the style of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, son

of Antoninus and grandson of Severus, he tacitl'y asserted his here·
ditary claim to the empire3 but, by affuming the tribunitiam and pro-
consular powers before they had been confer-red on him by a decree
of the senate, he offended the delicacy of Roman prejudice. This

*new and injudicious violation of the constitution was probably dic-

tated either by the ignorance of his Syrian courtiers‚ or the fierce
disdain of his military followers ⁵⁰.

As the attention of the new emperor was diverted by the most tri-
·fling amusement& he wasted many months in his luxurious progress
from Syria to Italy, passed at Nicomedia the first winter after his vic-
tory‚ and deferred till the ensuing summer his triumphal entry into
the capital. A. faithful picture, however, which preceded hisarrivzil,
