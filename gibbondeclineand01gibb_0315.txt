OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

great stream through the plains of Poland and Ruffia gave a
direfflon to their line of march, and a constant supply of fresh wa-
ter and pasturage to their numerous herds of cattle. They followed
the unknown course of the river, confident in their valour, and
careless of whatever power might oppose their progress. The
Bastarnae and the Venedi were the first who presented themselves;
and the flower of their youth, either from choiee or compulsion,
increased the Gothic army. The Bastarnae dwelt on the northern
fide of the Carpathian mountain83 the immense trae‘t of land that
separated the Bastarnae from the savages of F inland, was possessed,
or rather wasted, by the Venedi ²⁴: we have some reason to believe
that the first of these natione, which distinguished itself in the
Macedonian war ²⁵, and was afterwards divided into the formidable
tribes of the Peucini, the Borani, the Carpi, &c. derived its origin
from the Germans. With better authority, a Sarmatian extraction
may be affigned to the Venedi, who rendered themselves so famous
in the middle ages ²⁶. But the confusion of blood and manners on
that doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate ob-
servers ²⁷. As the Goths advanced nearer the Euxine sea, they
encountered a purer racc of Sarmatians, the jazyges, the Alani,
and the Roxolani 3 and they were probably the first Germans who
saw the mouths of the Borysthenes, and of the Tanais. If we
inquire into the charadieristic marks of the people of Germany and
-of Sarmatia, we shall discover that those two great portione. of human
kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or moveable
tents, by a close dress, or flowing garments, by the marriage of
one or of several wives, by a military force, consisting, for the most
part, either of infantry or of cavalry; and above all by the use of
