κ--Ὺ-ι covered an extent of ground consisting of between nine and ten Eng-

lissi acres. The form was quadrangulam, flanked with sixteen towers.
Two of the sides were near six hundred, and the other two near seven
hundred feet in length. The whole was construeted of a beautiful
free-stone, extra&ed from the neighbouring quarries of Trau or
Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itself. Four streets‚
intersecting each other at right angles, divided the several parts of
this great edifice‚ and the approach to the principal apartment
was from a stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden
gate. The approach was terminated by a peristylium of granite
columns, on one fide of which we discover the square templefof
AEsculapius‚ on the other the ofitagon temple of Jupiter. ‘The
latter -of those deities Diocletian.revered as the patron of his for-
tunes, the former as the protector of his health. By comparing¹

the present remains with the precepts of Vitruvius, the several -

parts of the building‚ the baths, bedebamber, the atrium, the bcffilica,
and the Cyzicene, Corinthiam, and Egyptian halls, have been
described with some degree of precision, or at least of probability.
Their forms were various, their proportions just, but they were
all attended with two imperfections, very repugnant to our modern
notioris of taste and conveniency. These stately rooms had
neither windows nor chimnies. They were lighted from the‘
top (for the building seems to have consisted of no more than onie
story), and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were
conveyed along the walls. The range of principal apartments
was prote&ed towards the south-west, by a portico five hundred and
seventeen feet long, which must have formed a very noble and
delightful walk, when the beauties of painting and sculpture were
added to those of the prospect.
