OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the European mountain, the forti-ess of Gibraltar is now scatcd.
The whole extentos the Mediterrancan Sea, its coasts, and its islands,
were comprised within the Roman dominion. Of the largcr islands,
the two Baleares, which derive their names of Majorca and Minorca
from their respe5tive size, are subje& at present, the former to Spain,
the latter to Great Britain. It is easler to deplore the fate, than to
describe the a&ual condition of Corsica. Two Italian sovereigns
assume a regal title from Sardinia and Sicily. Crete, or Candia,
with Cyprus, and most of the smaller issands of Greece and Asia,
have been subdued by the Turkish arms; whilst the little rock of
Malta defies their power, and has emerged‚ under the goverument
of its military Order, into farne and opulence.

This long enumeration of provinces, whose broken fragments
have formed so many powerful kingdoms, might almost induce us
to forgive the vanity or ignorance of the ancients. Dazzled with the
extensive sway, the irrefistible strength, and the real or affe-&ed mo-
deration of the emperors, they permitted themselves to despise‚ and
sometimes to forget‚ the outlying countries which had been left in
the enjoyment of a barbarous independence; and they gradually
usurped the licence of confounding the Roman monarchy with the
globe of the earth ⁸⁸. But the temper, as well as knowledge, ofa
modern historian, require a more sober and' accurate language. He
may impress a justet image of the greatness of Rome, by observing
that the empire was above two thousand miles in breadth, from the
wall of Antoninus and the northern limits of Dacia, to mount Atlas
and the tropic of Cancer3 that it extended, in length, more than
three thousand miles from the Western Ocean to the Euphrates ; that—
it was fituated in the finest part of the Temperate Zone, between
the twenty-fourth and fifty-fixth degrees of northern latitude 3
and that it was supposed to contain above sixteen hundred thousand
square miles, sor the most partos fertile and well cultivated land ³⁹.
