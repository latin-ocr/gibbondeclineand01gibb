of the creation had been finished in six days, their duration in their
present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to the
prophet Elijah‚ was fixed to fix thousand years ⁶¹. By the same
analogy it was inferred, that this long period of labour and con-
tention, which was now almost elapsed ⁶², would be succeeded by a
joyful Sabbath of a thousand years; and that Christ, with the tri-
umphant band of the saints and the ele& who had escaped death, or
who hadr been miraculoussy revived, would reign upon earth till the
time appointed for the last and general resurreetion. So pleafing
was this hope to the mind of believers‚ that the New Jerzgsalem, the

duced that number to 5500, and Eusebius has
contented himself with 5²00 years. These
calculations were formed on the Septuagint,
which was universally received during the
six first centuries. The authority of the Vul-
gate and of the Hebrew text has determined
the moderns, Protestants as well as Catholics,
to prefer a period of about 4000 years; though,
in the study of profane antiquity, they often
