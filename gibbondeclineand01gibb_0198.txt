THE DECLINE AND FALL

It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been
adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice ⁶⁰. Yet confining
oursclves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people,
and attested by grave and contemporary historiam, their inexpres-

sible infamy surpaffes that of any other age or country. The licensc
of an eastern monarch is secluded from the eye of curiosity by the
inacceffible walls of his seraglio. The sentiments of honour and
gallantry have introduced a refinement of pleasurc, a regard for de-
cency, and a respect for the public opinion, into the modern courts
of Europe3 but the corrupt and opulent nobles of Rome gratified
every vice that could be collected frorn the mighty conflux of nations
and manners. Secure of impunity, careless of censure, they lived
without restraint in the patient and humble society of their ssaves
and parasites. The emperor, in his turn, vievving every rank of his
subjeets with the same contemptuous indifference, afferted without
control his sovereign privilege of lust and luxury.

The most worthless of mankind are not afraid to condemn in

others the same disorders which theyallow in themselves3 and can
readily discover some nice difference of age, character, or station, to
justify the partial distinction. The licentious soldiers, who had
raised to the throne the diffolute son of Caracalla, blushed at their
ignominious choice, and turned with disgust from that monster, to
contemplate with pleasure the opening virtues of his cousin Alex-
ander the son of Mamaea. The crafty Maesa, senfible that her grand-
son Elagabalus must inevitably destroy himself by his own vices,
had provided another and surer support of her family. Embracing

a favourable moment of fondness and devotion, she had persuaded
the young emperor to adopt Alexander, and to invest him with the
title of Caesar, that his own divine occupatione might be no longer
