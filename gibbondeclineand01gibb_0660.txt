ψ which happened during his infancy. Before he gave himself to the

PubliC, he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity,
and he was more than forty years of age, when a grateful regard
for the memory of the virtuous Agricola, extorted from him the
most carly of those historical compofitions which will delight and
instrudl'. the most distant posterity. After making a trial of his.
strength in the lise of Agricola and the description of Germany, hev
conceived, and at length executed‚ a more arduous work; the his-
tory of Rome, in thirty books, from the fall of Nero to the acces-
sion of Nerva. The administration of Nerva introduced an age of
justice and prosperity‚ which Tacitus had destined for the occu-
pation of his old age ³³3 but when he took a nearer view of his
subjec‘n judging, perhaps, that it was a more honourable, or a less
invidious office, to record the vices of past tyrants, than to cele-
brate the virtues of a reigning monarch‚ he chose rather to relate,
under the form of anmals, the affions of the four immediate succefl'ors
of Augustus. To colleec, to dispose, and to adorn a series of fourscore
years, in an immortal work, every sentence of which is pregnant
with the deepest observations and the most lively imageS, was an un-
dertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself during
the greatest part of his life. In the last years of the reign of Trajan,
whilst the vidiorious monarch extended the power of Rome beyond

its ancient limits‚ the historian was describing‚ in the second and
fourth books of his annals, the tyranny of Tiberius ³⁹3 and the

emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne, before Tacitus,
in the regular prosecution of his work, could relate the fire of the
capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the unfortunate Christians.
At the distance of fixty years, it was the duty of the annalist to
