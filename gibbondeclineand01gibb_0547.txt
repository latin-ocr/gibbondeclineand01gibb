⁴Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the scenes of several k-v—-d

memorable fieges and battles ⁹⁹3 and though Constantine en-
countered a very obstinate refistance‚ he prevailed at length in the
contest, and the Goths were compelled to purchase an ignominious
retreat, by restoring the booty and prisoners which they had taken,
Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of the
emperor. He resolved to chastise as well asto repulse the insolent bar-
barians who had dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the head
of his legions he paffed the Danube, after repairing the bridge which
had been construosted by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest receffes
of Dacia ¹⁰⁰, and when he had inflieted a severe revenge, condescended
to give peace to the suppliant Goths, on condition that, as often
as they were required, they should supply his armies with a body
of forty thousand soldiers ¹⁰¹. Exploits like these were no doubt
honourable to Constantine and beneficial to the state; but it may
surely be questioned whether they ean justify the exaggerated as-
sertion of Eusebius, that ALL Sevi-Hm, as far as the extremity of
the North, divided as it was into so many names and nations of the
most various and savage manners, had been added by his vietorious
arms to the Roman empire ¹⁰².

⁹⁹ See Zofimus, l. ii. p. 93, 943 though Constantine were like the gardcns of Adonis,
the narrative of that historian is neither clear which fade and wither almost the moment

nor consistent. The Panegyric of Optatianus
(c. 23.) mentions the alliance of the Sarma-⁷
tiana with the Carpi and Getae, and points
out the several fields of battle. It is supposed,‚
that the Sarmatian games, celebrated in the
month of November, derived *their origin
from the success of this war.

¹0⁰ In the Caesars ofjulian (p. 329· Corn-
mentaire de Spanheim‚ p. 252.) Constantine
boasts, that he had recovered the province
(Dacia), which Trajan had subdued. But it
i> ‘msinuated by Silenus, that-the conquests osv

they appear.

This passage, however, is taken from a ge—
neral declamation on the greatness of Con-
stantine, and not from any particular account
