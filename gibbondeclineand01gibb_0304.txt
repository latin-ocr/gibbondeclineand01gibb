286 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ἿΧΑ Ρ· 'The general conspiracy which terrified the Romans under the

2-w—1 reign of Marcus Antoninus, comprehended almost all the nations of
ffdsonnfiigiinst Germany, and even Sarmatia, from the mouth of the Rhine to that
ngffiflssffl ¹of the Danube³². It is impossible for us to determine whether
this hasty confederation was formed by necessity, by reason, or by
paffi0n3 but we may rest affured‚ that the barbarians were neither
allured by the indolence, or provoked by the ambition, of the Roman
monarch. This dangerous invasion required all the firmness and
vigilance of Marcus. He fixed generals of ability in the several
stat10ns of attack, and assumed in person the conducit of the most
important province on the Upper Danube. After a long and doubt-
ful conflich the spirit of the barbarians was subduedz The Qadi
and the Marcomanni⁸³, who had taken the lead in the war, were
the most severely punished in its catastrophe. They were corn-
manded to retire five miles ⁸4 from their own banks of the Danube,
and to deliver up the fiower of the youth, who were immediately
sent into Britain, a remote issand, where they might be secure as
hostageS, and useful as soldiers⁸⁵. On the frequent rebellions of
the Qadi and Marcomanni, the irritated emperor resolved to reduce
their country into the form of a province. His designs were dis-
appointed by death. This formidable league, however, the only
one that appears in the two first centuries of the Imperial history,
was entirely diffipated, without leaving any traces behind in Germany.
