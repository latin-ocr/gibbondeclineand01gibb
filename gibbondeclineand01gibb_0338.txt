which is the just result of knowledge and experience. Warriors of
such a daring spirit must have often murmured against the cowardice
of their guides, who required the strongest affurances of a settled
calm before they would venture to embark3 and would scarcely
ever be tempted to lose sight of the land. Such, at least, is the
praffice of the modern Turks ¹⁰⁴3 and they are probably not in-
ferior, in the art of navigation, to the ancient inhabitants of Bos-
phorus.

The fleet of the Goths‚ leaving the coast of Circaffia on the left
hand, first appeared before Pityus ¹⁰⁵, the utmost limits of the Ro-
man provinces ; a city provided with a convenient port and fortificd
with a strong wall. Here they met with a refistance more obsti-
nate than they had reason to expect from the feeble garrison of a
distant fortress. They were repulsed3 and their disappointment
seemed to diminish the terror of the Gothic name. As long as
Succcssianus, an officer of superior rank and merit, defended that
frontier‚ all their efforts were ineffectua13 but as soon as he was
removed by Valerian to a more honourable but less important
station, they resumed the attack of Pityus 3 and, by the destruition
of that city, obliterated the memory of their former disgrace ¹⁰⁶.

Circling round the eastern extremity of the Euxine sea, the
navigation from Pityus to Trebizond is about three hundred
miles ¹⁰⁷. The course of the Goths carried thern in sight of the
country os Colchis, so famous by the expedition of the Argo-
nauts ; and they even attempted, though without success, to pillage
a rich temple at the mouth of the river Phasis. Trebizond, cele-
