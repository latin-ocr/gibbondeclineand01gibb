Auxiliaries.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

East was encumbered. Their more useful arms consisted in a
helmet, an oblong ssiield, light boots‚ and a coat of mail. Ajave-
lin, and a long broad swmd, were their principal weapons of
offence. The use of lances and of iton maces they seem to have bor-

The safety and honour of the empire was principally intrusted to
the legions, but the policy of Rome condescended to adopt every
useful instrument of war. Confiderable lev'ies were regularly made
among the provincials, who had not yet deserved the honourable
distinetion of Romans. Many dependent princes and communities,
dispersed round the frontiers, were permitted, for a while, to hold
their freedom and security by the tenure of military service ⁵⁵.

or persuaded to consume their dangerous valour in remote climates,
and for' the benefit of the state ⁵⁶. All these were included under

the general name of auxiliaries; and howsoever they might vary ac-
cordimg to the difference of times and circumstances, their numbers
were seldom much inferior to those of the legions themselves ⁵⁷.

Among the auxiliaries, the bravest and most faithful hands were
placed under the command of praefects and centurions‚ and severely
trained in the arts of Roman discipline ; but the far greater part re-
tained those arms, to which the nature of their country, or their
early habits of life, more peculiarly adapted them. By this jn,
