4 THE DECLINE AND FALL

k—ae-—l as interest of every Roman general, to guard the frontiers intrusted
to his care, without aspiring to conquests which might have proved
no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished barbarians ⁵.
ξὲζᾜθὲἃξῗ The only acceffion which the Roman empire received, during
the first ex-

the first century of the Christian AEra, was the province of Britain·
In this fingle instance the sueceffors of Caesar and Augustus were
persuaded to follow the example of the former, (rather than the
precept of the latter. The proximity of its situation to the coast of
Gaul seemed to invite their arms3 the pleasing‚ though doubtful
intelligence of *a pearl fishery, attracted their avarice⁶3 and as
Britain was viewed in the light of a distinet and insulated world,
the conquest scarcely formed any exception to the general system of
continental measures. After a war of about forty years, under-
taken by the most stupid ⁷, maintained by the most dissolute,
and terminated by the most timid of all the emperors, the far
greater part of the issand submitted to the Roman yoke⁸. The
various tribes of Britons possessed valour without conduct, and the

ception to it,

love of freedom without the spirit of union. They took up arms
with savage fierceness3 they laid them down, or turned them
against each other with wild inconstancy; and while they fought-
fingly‚ they were successivel'y subdued. Neither the fortitude of

Agricola, were checked and recalled, in the

course of their victories. Corbulo was put
to death. Military merit, as itis admirably
expressed by Tacitus, was, in the strietest
sense of the word, imperatoria virtus.

⁶ Caesar himself conceals that ignoble mo-
tive3 but it is mentioned by Suetonius, c.

47. The British pearls proved, however, of

little value, on account of their dark and
livid colour. Tacitus observes, with reason,
(in Agricola, e. 12.) that it was an inherent
defett. ‘⁴ Ego facilius crediderim, naturam

(he wrote under Claudius) that by the suc-
cess of the Roman arms, the issand and its
savage inhabitants would soon be better
known. It is amusing enough to peruse such
passages in the midst of London.

Tacitus, in the life of Agricola, and copi-
