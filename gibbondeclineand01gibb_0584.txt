THE DECLINE AND FALL

Whilst the happiness and glory os a temporal reign were promised

«μον-’,ψ to the disciples of Christ, the most dreadful calamities were de-

Conflagra-

tion ofRome nounced against an unbelieving world. The edification of the New

and of the
world.

jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of the
mystic Babylon3 and as long as the emperors who reigned before
Constantine persisted in the profeflion of idolatry‚ the epithet'of
Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of Rome. A re-
gular series was prepared of all the moral and physlcal evils which
can affliet a flourishing nation3 intestine discord, and the invasion
of the fiercest barbarians from the unknown regions of the North ς
pestilence and famine, comets and eclipses, earthquakes and inun-

dations ⁶⁸. All these vvere only so many preparatory and alarming

signs of the great catastrophe of Rome, when the country of the
Scipios and Caesars should be consumed by a flame from Heaven,
and the city of the seven hills, with her palaces, her temples‚
and her triumphal arches, should be buried in a vast lake of fire

and brimstone. -It might, however, afford some consolation to

⁴ Roman vanity‚ that the period of their empire would be that of

the world itself; which, as it had once perissied by the clement of
water, was destined to experience a second and a speedy destruction
from the element of fire. In the opinion of a general conflagration‚
the faith of the Christian very happily coincided with the tradition
we may learn from the complaint of Sulpicius

Severus, that their sentence had been ratified
by the greater number of Christians of his

infallibility on all the books of Scripture,
contained in the Latin Vulgate, in the num-
ber of which the Apocalypse was fortunately

time. From what causes then is the Apoca-
lypse at present so generally received by the
Greek, the Roman, and the Protestant
churches? The following ones may be as—
signed. 1. The Greeks were subdued by
the authority of an impostor, who, in the
lizx'th century, assumed the character of Dio-
nysius the Areopagite. 2. A just apprehen—
fion, that the grammarians might become
more important than the theologians, engaged
the council of Trent to fix the seal of their

included. (Fra Paolo, lstoria del Concilio
Tridentino, Lvii.) 3. The advantage of
turning those mysterious prophecies against
the See of Rome, inspired the protestants with
uncommon venei-arion forsso uscful an ally.
