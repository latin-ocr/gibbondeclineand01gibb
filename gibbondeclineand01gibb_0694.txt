THE DECLINE AND FALL

tive bissiop. When he harangued his people from the pulpit‚ Paui' .
affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures of an Asiatic
sophist, while the cathedra] resounded with the loudest and most ex-
travagant acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence. Against
those who refisted his power, or refused to flatter his vanity, the
prelate of Antioch was arrogant, rigid, and inexorable3 but he re-

laxed the discipline, and lavished the treasures, of the church on his ·

dependent clergy, who were permitted to imitate their master in
the gratification of every sensual appetite. For Paul indulged him-
self very freely in the pleasures of the table, and he had received
into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women, as them
constant companions of his leisure moments ¹²³.

Notwithstanding these scandalous vices, if Paul of Samosata-

had preserved the purity of the orthodox saith, his reign over the*

capital of Syria would have ended only with his life3 and had a
seasonable persecution intervened, an effort of courage might perhaps
have placed him in the rank of saints and martyrs. Some nice and.
subtle errors, which he imprudently adopted and obstinately main-
tained, concerning the doetrine of the Trinity, excited the zeal and
indignation of the eastern churches ¹²⁹. From Egypt to the Euxine
sca, the bishops were in arms and in motion. Several councils
were held, corifutations were published, excommunications were
pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and
refused, treaties were concluded and violated, and at length Paul of
Samosata was degraded from his episcopal character, by the sentence
of seventy or eighty bishops, who assembled for that purpose at
Antioch, and who, without consultiug the rights of the clergy or-
people, appointed a sueceffor by their own authority. The manifest
