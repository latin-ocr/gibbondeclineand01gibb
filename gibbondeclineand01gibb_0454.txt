43⁴4 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H Α Ρ· two Ca fars restored new vigour to the Roman arms3 and while the
&Egi—1 Rhine vs as guarded by the presence of Maximian, his brave al]-
sociate Constantius assumed the conduci: of the British viar. His
first enterprise was against the important place of Boulogne A
stupendous mole, raised across the entrance of the harbour, inter-
A. D. 292. cepted all hopes of relief. The town surrendered after an obstinate
defence; and a considerable part of the naval strength of Caraufius
