stances of his exploit85 but, if we could be indulged in the allu- C ΡξΠΑ Pr
sion, We might distribute into three aCts this memorable tragedy. ι-ν--ι

Ι. The decifive battle was fought near Naissus, a city of Dardania.
The legions at first gave way, oppress'ed> by numbers, and dismayed
by missortunes. Their ruin was inevitable, had not the abilities
of their emperor prepared a seasonable relief. A large detachment
rising out of the secret and difficolt paffes of the mountains, which, by
his order, they had occupied, suddenly affailed the rear of the victo·
rious Goths. The favourable instant was improved by the affwsty
of Claudius. He revived the coni-age of his troop3‚ restored their
ranks, and preffed the barbarians on every side. Fifty thousand men
are reported to have been ssain in the battle of Naissus. Several
large bodies of barbariam, covering their retreat with a moveable
fortification of vvaggons‚ retired‚ or rather escaped, from the field
of ssaughter. 11. We may presume 'that some insurmountable dif-
ficulty, the fadgue, perhaps, or the disobedience, of the conquerors,
prevented Claudius from completing in one day the destruetion of
the Goths. The war was diffused over the provinces of Maesia,
Thrace, and Macedonia, and its operations drawn out into a variety
of marches‚ surprises, and tumultuary engagements‚ as well by sea
as by land. When the Romans suffered any losS‚ it was commonly
occasioned by their own cowardice or rassmess3 but the superior
talents of the emperor, his perfect knowledge of the country, and his—
judicious choice of'measures as well as officers, affured on most occa-
sions the success of his arms. The immense booty, the fruit ofso many-
vi&ories‚ confisted for the greater partos cattle and ssaves„ A sele&
body of the Gothic youth was received among the imperial troops;
the remainder was sold into servitude ; and so considerable was the
number of female captives, that every soldier obtained to his share
two or three women. A circumstance from which we may con-
clude, that the invaders entertained some defigns of settlement as
well as of plunder; since even in a naval expedition they were ac-

companied.
