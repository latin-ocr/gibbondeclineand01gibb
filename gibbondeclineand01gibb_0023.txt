OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 5

Druids could avert the ssavery of their country, or resist the steady μαψ-θ
progress of the Imperial generals, who maintained the national
glory, when the throne was disgi-aced by the weakest, or the most
vicious of mankind. At the very time when Domitian, confined to
his palace, felt the terrors which he inspired ; his legion8‚ under the
command of the virtuous Agricola, defeated the collected force
of the Caledonians, at the foot of the Grampian hills; and his fleets,

conquest of Britain was considered as already atchieved ς and it was
the design of Agricola to complete and ensure his succes5‚ by the
easy reduction of Ireland, for which, in his opinion, one legion and
a few auxiliaries were sufficient ⁹. The western isse might be
improved into a valuable poffeffion, and the Britons would wear

their chains with the less reluctance‚ if the prospe& and example of
freedom was on every fide removed from before their eyes.

But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal
from the government of Britain3 and for ever disappointed‘ this
rational, though extensive scheme of conquest. Before his depar-

dominion. He had observed, that the issand is almost divided into
two unequal parm, by the opposite gulfs, or as they are now called,
the Firths of Scotland. Across the narrow interval of about forty
miles, he had drawn a line of military stations‚ which was after-
wards fortified in the reign of Antoninus Pius, by a turf rampart
erected on foundations of stone¹⁰. This wall of Antoninus, at a
