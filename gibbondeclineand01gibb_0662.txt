The followers of Judas, who impelled

their countrymen into rebellion, were soon buried under the ruins
of Jerusalem 3 whilst those of Jesus, known by the more celebrated
name of Christiane, diffused themselves over the Roman empire. How
natural was it for Tacitus, in the time of Hadrian, to appropriate
to the Christians‚ the guilt and the sufferings, which he might, with
:far greater truth and justice, have attributed to a se& whose odious
memory was almost extinguistied! 4. XVhatever opinion may be
entertained of this conjed'cure (for it is no more than a conjeeture), it
