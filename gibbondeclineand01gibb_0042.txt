lencia, Catalonia, and Arragon‚ all contributed to form the third
and most considerable of the Roman governments, which, from the
name of its capital, was styled the Province of Tarragona⁷⁰. Of
the native barbariam, the Celtiberians were the most powerful, as
the Cantabrians and Asturians proved the most obstinate. Confident
in the strength of their mountains, they were the last who sub-
mitted to the arms of Rome, and the first who threw off the yoke

of the Arabs.

Ancient Gaul, as it contained the whole country between the
Pyrenees, the Alps, the Rhine‚ and the Ooean, was of greater extent
than modern France. To the dominions of that powerful monarchy‚
with its recent acquisitions of Alsace and Lorraine, we must add the
dutchy of Savoy‚ the cantons of Switzerland, the four elec‘torates of
the Rhine‚ and the territories of Liege‚ Luxemburgh‚ Hainault, Flan-
ders, and Brabant. When Augustus gave laws to the conquests of his
father, he introduced a division of Gaul equally adapted to
the progress of the legions, to the course of the rivers, and to
the principal national distinctions, which had comprehended above

an hundred independent states⁷¹. The sea—coast of the Medi-
terranean‚ Languedoc‚ Provence, and Dauphine, received their
provincial appellation from the colony of Narbonne. The go-
