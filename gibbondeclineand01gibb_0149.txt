OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to
be disposed of to the best bidder by public auctiori ¹⁰.

This infamous offer, the most insolent excess of military licence,
diffused a universal grief, ssiame, and indignation throughout the
city. It reached at length the ears of Didius Julianus, a wealthy
senator, who, regardless of the public calamities„ was indulging him-
self in the luxury of the table ¹¹. His wife and his daughter, his
freedmen and his pamffies, eafily convinced him that he deserved
the throne, and earnestly conjured him to embrace so fortunate
an opportunity. The vain old man hastened to the Praetorian camp,
where Sulpicianus was still in treaty with the guards; and began to
bid against him from the foot of the rampart. The unworthy ne-
gociation was t1·ansa6ted by faithful emissaries, who paffed alter-
nately firom one candidate to the other, and acquainted each of them
with the offers of his rival. Sulpicianus had already promised a
donative of five thousand drachms (above one hundred and fixty
pounds) to each soldier; when Julian, eager fonthe prize‚ rose at

upwards of two hundred pounds sterling. The gates of the camp
were instantly thrown open to the purchaser3 he was declared em-
peror, and received an oath of allegiance from the soldiers, who re·-
tained humanity enough to stipulate that he should pardon and for-
get the competition of Sulpicianus.

It was now incumbent on the Praetorians to fulfil the conditions
of the sale. They placed their new sovereign, whom they served
and despised‚ in the centre of their ranks, surrounded him on every
fide with their ffiields, and conducted him in close order of battle
through the deserted streets of the city. The senate was commanded
