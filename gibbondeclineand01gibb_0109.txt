OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

vpetty officer of the revenue ³⁵5 his own merit had raised him, in an
advanced age to the empire3 but his merit was rather useful than
ffiining, and his virtuespwere disgracedssby astri& and even sordid
parsimony. Such a prince consulted his true interest by the affoc'i-
ation of a son, whose more splendid and amiable charadler might

turn the public attention, from the obscure origin, to the future

glories of the Flavian house. Under the mild administration of

Titus, the Roman world enjoyed a transient felicity, and his belovcd
‘memory served to protect, above fifteen years, the vices of his brother
Domitian. Α
Nerva had scarcely accepted the purple from the affaffins of Do-
mitian, before he⁴ discovered that his feeble age was unable to stem
thextorrent of public disorders, which had multiplied under the long
tyranny of his predeceffor. His mild disposition was respeered by
the good3 but the degenerate Romans required a more vigorous
chax-aster, whose justice should st'rike terror into the guilty. Though
¹he had several relations, he fixed, his choice οηᾎὶ stranger. He
adopted Trajan, then about fort'y years of age, and who com-
manded a powerful army in the Lower Germany; and immediately,
by a decree of the senate, declared him his colleague and successor

in the empire ³⁶. It is fincerely to be lamented‚ that whilst we are .› .

fatigued with the disgustful relation of Nero’s crimes and foffies,
we are reduced to colle& the affions of Trajan from the glimmer-
ings of an abridgment, or the doubtful light of a panegyric.
There remains‚ however, one panegyric far removed beyond the
suspicion of flattery. Above two hundred and 'fifty years after the
death of Trajan, the senate, in pouring out the customary accla-
mations on the acceffion of a new emperor, wished that hc might
surpass the felicity of Augustus, and the virtue of Trajan ³⁷.
