of the circus. The spacious and ssiady forest was immediately filled
with a thousand ostriehes, a thousand stage, a thousand fallow deer, and

,a thousand wild boars ; and all this variety of game was abandoned

to the riotous impetuofity of the multitude. The tragedy of the suc-

›ceeding day confisted in the maffacre of an hundred lions, an equal

number of lioness’es, two hundred leopards, and three hundred
bears ⁸⁶. The collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his
triumph, and which his sueceffor exhibited in the secular games,
was less remarkable by the number than by the fingularity of the
animals. Twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and varie-
gated beauty to the eyes of the Roman people ²⁷. Ten elks, and as
many camelopards‚ the loftiest and most harmless creatures that
wander over the plains of Sarmatia and AEthiopia, were contrasted
with thirty African hyaenas, and ten Indian tygers, the most im-
placable sava-ges of the tort-id zone. The unoffending strength with
which Nature has endowed the greater quadrupedeS, was admired
in the rhinocer‚os the hippopotamus of the Nile ⁸⁸, and a majestic

troop of thirty-two elephante ⁸.⁹ While the populace gazed with
stupid wonder on the splendid show, the naturalist might indeed ob-

serve the figure and propertics of so many different species, trans-
ported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre
