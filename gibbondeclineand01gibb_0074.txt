surrounded by sophists, who acknovvledged, without mmeramme, the
superiority of a rich and generous rival⁶⁹. The monuments of his
genius have perished 3 some considerable ruins still preserve the fame
of his taste and munificence: modern travellers have measured the
remains of the stadium which he construeted at Athens. It was fix
hundred feet in length, ·built entirely of white marble, capable of
admitting the whole body of the people, and finished in four years,
whilst Herod was prefident of the Athenian games. To the memory
of his wife Regilla, he dedicated a theatre, scarcely to be paralleled ,
in the empire: no wood except cedar, very curioussy carved, was<
employed in any part of the building. The Odeum, defigned by
Pericles for musical performance, and the rehearsal of new tragedies,
had been a trophy of the victory of the arts over Barbarie greatness ;
as the timbers employed in the construction confisted chiefly of the
masts of the Persian veffels. Notwithstanding the repairs bestowed
on that ancient edifice by a king of Cappadocia, it was again fallen .
to decay. v Herod restored its ancient beauty and magnificence.
Nor was the liberality of that illustrious citizen confined to the walls
of Athens. The most splendid ornaments bestowed on the temple
of Neptune In the Isthmus, a theatre at Corinth, a stadium at Delphi,
a bath at Thermopylae‚ and an aqueduet at Canufium in Italy,
were insufficient to exhaust his treasures. The people of Epirus,
Thess'aly, Euboea, Boeotia, and Peloponnesus, experienced his fa-
vours3 and many inscriptions of the cities of Greece and Afia grate-
fully style Herodes Atticus their patron and benefaecor ⁷⁰.

In the commonwealths of Athens and Rome, the modest fim-
pl6icity of private houses announced the equal condition of freedom ;
