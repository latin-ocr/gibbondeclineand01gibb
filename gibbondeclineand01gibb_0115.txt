OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

These gloomy apprehensione. had been already justified by the ex-
perience of the Romans. The annals of the emperors exhibit a strong
and various picture of human nature, which we should vainly seek
among the mixed and doubtful characters of modern history. In the
conduct of those monarche. we may trace the utmost lines of vice and
virtue3 the most exalted perfeetiom and the meanest degeneracy of
our own speeies. The golden age of Trajan and the Antonines had
been preceded by an age of iron. It is almost superfluous to enu-
merate the unworthy suceeffors of Augustus. Their unparalleled
vices, and the splendid theatre on which they were acted, have saved
them from oblivion. The dark unrelenting Tiberius, the furious
Caligula, the feeble Claudius, the profligate and cruel Nero, the
beastly Vitellius ⁵⁰, and the timid inhuman Domitian, are condemned
to everlasting infamy. During fourscore years (excepting only the
short and doubtful respite of Vespafian's reign ⁵¹) Rome groaned
beneath an unremitting tyranny‚ Which exterminated the ancient
families of the republic, and was fatal to almost every virtue, and
every talent, that arose in that unhappy period.

Under the reign of these monsters, the ssavery of the Romans

cafioned by their former liberty, the other by their extensive con-
quests, which rendered their condi¹3ion more completely wretched
than that of the viCtims of tyranny in any other age or country.
