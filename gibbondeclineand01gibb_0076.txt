and were filled with amphitheatres, theatres, temples, porticos, tri-
umphal arches, baths‚ and aquedu&s, all varioussy conducive to
the health, the devotion, and the pleasures of the meanest citizen.
The last mentioned of those edifices deserve our peculiar attention.
The boldness of the enterprise, the solidity of the execution, and the
uses to which they were subservient‚ rank the aquedu&s among the
noblest monuments of Roman genius and power. The aquedudts of
the capital claim a just pre-eminence3 but the curious traveller‚
who, without the light of history, should examine those of Spoleto‚
of Metz, or of Segovia, would very naturally conclude, that those
provincial towns had formerly been the refidence of some potent
monarch. The solitudes of Asia and Africa were once covered
with flourishing eines, whose populousness‚ and even whose ex-
istence, was derived from such artificial supplies of a perennial

We have computed the inhabitants, and contemplated the public
works, of the Roman empire. The observation of the number and

the expreffio'n might be intended ⁷4, there is not any reason to
believe the country less populous in the age of the Antonines‚ than,
