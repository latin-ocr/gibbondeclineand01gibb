an army of Germans into Gaul, prevailed on the powerful cities of
Treves and Langrcs to embrace his cause, defeated the legions,
destroyed their fortified camps, and employed against the Romans
the military knowledge which he had acquired in their service.
When at length, after an obstinate struggle, he yielded to the power
of the empire‚ Civilis secured himself and his country by an ho-
nourable treaty. The Batavians still continued to occupy the issands
ofthe Rhine ⁷⁶, the allies not the servants ofthe Roman monarchy.
ΙΙ. The strength of ancient Germany appears formidable, when we
consider the effe&s that might have been produced by its united
effort. The wide extent of country might very poffibly contain a
million of warriors, as all who were of an age to bear arms, were
of a temper to use thern. But this fierce multitude, incapable of
concerting or executing any plan of national greatness‚ was agi-
tated by various and often hostile intentione. Germany was divided
into more than forty independent states; and even in each state the

union of the several tribes was extremely loose and precarious. ’

The barbarians were easily provoked3 they knew not how to for-
give an injury, much less an insult; their resentments were bloody
and implacable. The casual disputes that so frequently happened
in their tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking, were sufficient
to inflame the minds of whole nations; the private feud of any
considerable chieftains diffused itself among their followers and al·-
lies. To chastise the insolent, or to plunder the defenoeless, were
alike causes of war. The most formidable states of Germany af-
fected to encompass their territories with a wide frontier of solitude
and devastation. The awful distance preserved by their neighbours‚
attested the terror of their arms, and in some measure defended them
from the danger of unexpeeted incursions ⁷⁷.
