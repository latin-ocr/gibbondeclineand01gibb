538 THE DECLINE AND FA'LL

C Ῑζίΰ* P. ment of his peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his ssock

ι-,Ν the same implicit obedience as if that favourite metaphor had been
literally just, and as if the ssiepherd¹ had been of a more exalted

nature than that of his ssiecp¹¹⁸.

This obedience, however, was
not imposed without some efforts on one side, and some resistance
on the other. The democratical part of the constitution was, in
many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested
opposition of the inferior clergy. But their patriotism received the
ignominious epithets of faction and l'chism3 and the episcopal cause
was indebted for its rapid progress to the labours of many active
prelatos, who, like Cypriani of Carthage‚ could reconcile the arts of
the most ambitione statesman with the Christian virtues which seem
ada-pted to the character of a saint and martyr '‘⁹-

Pre-emic- The same causes which at first had destroyed the equality of the
ffliffipociliissz preihyters, introduced among the bilhops a pre-eminence of rank,

charcha. and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction. As often as in the
spring and autumn they met in provincial synod, the difference of
personal merit and reputation was very sensibly felt among the mem-
bers of the affembly, and the multitude was governed by the wis-
dom and eloquence of the few. But the order of public proceed-
ings required a more regular and less invidious distinction3 the
office of perpetual prefidents in the councils of each province, was
conferred on thebishops of the principal city, and these aspiring
prelates, who soon acquired the lofty titles of Metropolitans and
Friniates, secretly prepared themselves to ufurp over their episcopal

brethren the same authority which the bishops had so lately assumed
