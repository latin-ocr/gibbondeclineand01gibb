OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The final abolition of the Praetorian guards was a measure of C H A
prudence as well as of revenge. Those haughty troops, whose · ---------

numbers and privileges had been restored, and even augmented‚ by

Maxentius, were for ever suppreffed by Constantine. Their foi tisied
camp was destroyed, and the fcw Praetorians who had escaped the
fury of the sword, were dispersed among the legions, and banished
to the frontiers of the empne, where they might be serviceable

without again becoming dangerous ⁷⁵. By suppreffing the troops
which were usually stationed in Rome, Constantine gave the fatal

blow to the dignity of the senate and people, and the disarmed
capital was exposed without protection to the insults or neglecl: of
its distant master. We may observe, that in this last effort to
preserve their expiring freedom, the Romans, from the appre-
henfion of a tribute, had raised Maxentius to the throne. He ex-
atsted that tribute from the senate, under the name of a free gift.
They implored the affistance of Constantine. He vanquiIhed the
tyram, and converted the free gift into a perpetual tax. The
senators, according to the declaration which was required of their
property, were divided into several classes. The most opulent paid
annually eight pounds of gold, the next class paid four, the last
two, and those whose poverty might have claimed an exemption‚
were affess‘ed however at seven pieces of gold. Befides the regular
members of the senate, their sons, their descendants, and even their
relations, enjoyed the vain privileges, and supported the heavy
burdens‚ of the senatorial'order3 nor will it any longer excite
our surprise, that Constantine ss10uld be attentive to increase the
number of persons who were included under so useful a descrip-
