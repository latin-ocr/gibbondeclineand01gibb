OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

fortune, till, by the eonfession of his enemies‚ he had exhausted
every resource both of valour and policy'⁶. This memorable
war, with a very {hort suspenfion of hostilities, lasted five years;
and as the emperor could exert, without controul, the whole force
of the state, it was terminated by the absolute submiffion of the
barbarians ¹⁷. The new province of Dacia, which formed a second
exception to the precept of Augustus, was about thirteen hun-

Niester, the Teyss, or Tibiscus, the Lower Danube, and the Euxine
Sea. The vestiges of a military road may still be traced from the
banks of the Danube to the neighbourhood of Bender, a place
famous in modern history, and the actual frontier of the Turkish
and Russian empires'⁸. ⁴

continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than

vice of the most exalted charasters. The praises of Alexander,
transmitted by a succeflion of poets and historiam, had kindled a

emperor undertook an expedition against the nations of the east, but
he lamented with a figh that his advanced age scarcely left him any
hopes of equalling the renown of the son of Philip¹⁹. Yet the
success of Trajan, however transient, was rapid and specious. The
degenerate Parthians, broken by intestine discord, fled before his
arms. He descended the river Tigris in triumph, from the moun-
tains of Armenia to the Persian gulph. He enjoyed the honour
of being the first, as he was the last, of the Roman generals, who
