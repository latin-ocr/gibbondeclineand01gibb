The senate of Rome, loling all connexion with the> Imperial court.
and the adtual constitution, was left a venerable but useless monument
of antiquity on the Capitoline hill.

When the Roman princes had lost sight of the senate and of their
ancient capital, they easily forgot the origin and nature of their
legal power. The civil offices. of consul, of proconsul, of censor,
and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed, betrayed

to the people its republican extrastion. Those modest titles were,
laid afide ⁹⁷3 and if they still distinguished their high station by the

appellation of Emperor, or ΙΜΡΕ RATO R, that word was understood·
in a new and* more dignified sense, and no longer denoted the genef

The name of Emperor, which was at first of a military nature, was
associated with another of a more servile kind. The epithet of
Dominus, or Lord, in its primitive signification, was expreffive,
not of the authority of a prince over his subjecte, or of a com-
