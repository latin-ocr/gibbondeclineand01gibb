THE DECLINE AND FALL

for his ungrateful temper to forgive the generous fidelity which
had raised him to the throne, and supported him against all his
enemies. The lives of the senators were exposed to his jealous
suspicions, the distionour of their wives and daughters heightened·
the gratification of his sensual paffions ⁴5. It may be presumed,
that an Imperial lover was seldom reduced to sigh in vain; but
whenever persuasion proved ineffeetual, he had recourse to violence ;
and there remains one memorable example of a noble matron,
who preserved her chastity by a voluntary death. The soldiers
were the only order of men whom he appeared to respecCt, or
studied to⁴ please. He filled Rome and Italy with armed troops,
connived at their tumults‚ suffered them with impunity to plunder,
and even to maffacre‚ the defenceless people ⁴⁶3 and indulging

Maxentius often bestowed on his military favourites the splendid
villa, or the beautiful wife, of a senator. A prince of such a

might purchase the support, but he could never obtain the esteem,
of the army. Yet his pride was equal to his other vices. Whilst
he paffed his indolent life, either within the 'walls of his palace,.
or in the neighbouring gardens of Sallust, he was repeatedly heard
to declare, that he alone was emperor, and that the other princes
were no more than his lieutenants‚ on whom he had devolved the
defence of the frontier provinces, that he might enjoy without inter-
