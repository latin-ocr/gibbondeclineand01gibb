OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

be true that he was a person of rank and education, those circum·
stances could serve only to aggravate his guilt. He was burnt, or
rather roasted, by a ssow fire; and his executioners, zealous to re-
venge the personal insult which had been offered to the emperors,
exhausted every refincment of cruclty‚ without being able to subdue
his‚patience, or to alter the steady and insulting smile which in his
dying agonies he still preserved in his countenance. The Christianus,
though they confeffed that his conduct had not been strietly con-

faithful brethren‚ the eunuchs of the palace‚ against the lives of
two emperors, whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of
the church of God. Jealousy and resentment prevailed in every
breast, but especially in that of Diocletian. A great number of
persons, distinguished either by the offices which they had filled,
or by the favour which they had enjoyed, were thrown into prison,
