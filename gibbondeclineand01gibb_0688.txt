rus, they formed a domestic but more honourable connexion with(
the new court. The emperor was persuaded, that, in a dangerous
fickness, he had derived some benefit, either spiritual or phyfical,
from the holy oil‚ with which one of his ssaves had anointed him.
He always treated with peculiar distinction several persons of both
sexes who had embraced the new religion. The ,nurse as well as
the preceptor of Caracalla were Christian53 and if that young prince
ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity‚ it was occasioned by an in-
cident, which, however trifling, bore some relation to the cause of
Christianity ¹0³. Under the reign of Severus, the fury of the popu-
lace was checked 3 the rigour of ancient laws was for some time sus-
pended 3 and the provincial governors were satisfied with receiving
an annual present from the churches within their jurisdictim„ as the
price, or as the reward, of their moderatiori ¹⁵⁹. The controversy
concerning the precise time of the celebration of Easter armed the
bishops of Alia and Italy against each other, and was considered as

attention, and to have alienated the mind, of Severus. With the

could not be carried into stri& execution, without exposing to danger
and punishment the most zealous of their teachers and miffionaries. In
