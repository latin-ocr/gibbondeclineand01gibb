nity . One dangerous maxim, worthy of a tyrant, was remem-
bered and abused by Caracalla, “ To secure the affections of the
“ army, and to esteem the rest of his subjeets as of little moment ³⁷.’‘
But the liberality of the father had been restrained by prudence, and
his indulgence to the troops was tempered by firmness and autho-
rity. The careless profusiori of the son was the policy of one reign,
and the inevitable ruin both of the army and of the empire. The
vigour of the soldiers, instead of being confirmed by the severe dis-

cipline of campe, melted away in the luxury of cities. The exces-

five increase of their pay and donatives ³⁸

exhausted the state to
enrich the military order, whose modesty in peace, and service in
war, is best secured by an honourable poverty. The demeanor of
Caracalla was haughty and full of pride; but with the troops he

forgot even the proper dignity of his rank, encouraged their inso-

³⁵ Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1307· Herodian,
1. iv. p. 158. The former represents it as a
cruel massacre, the latter as a perfidious one
too. It seems probable, that the Alexan-
drians had irritated the tyrant by their rail-
leries, and perhaps by their tumults.

³⁷ Dion, 1. lxxvi. p. 1284. Mr. Wotton
(Hist. of Rome, p. 330.) suspeeis that this
maxim was invented by Caracalla himself
and attributed to his father.

³⁸ Dion (l. lxxviii. p. 1343.) informs us
that the extraordinary gifts of Caracalla to
the army amounterl annually to seventy mil-
lions of drachmae (about two millions three
hundred and ntty thousand pounds). There
is another passage in Dion, concerning the

ἦ

military pay, infinitely curious; were it not
obscure, imperfect, and probably corrupt.
The best sense seems to be, that the Praeto-
rian guards received twelve hundred and
fifty drachmae (sorty pounds) a year. (Dion,
l. lxxvii. p. ¹307·) Under the reign of Au,
gastus, they were paid at the rate cf two
drachmae, or denarii, per day, 7²0 a year
(Tacit. Annal. i. 17.). Domitian, who in-
creased the soldier’s pay one fourth, must
have raised the Praetorians to 960 drachmae
(Gronovius de Pecunia Veteri, 1. iii. c. 2.).Δ
These successive augmentations ruined the
empire, for with the soldier's pay, their num-
bers too were increased. We have seen the
Praetorians alone increased from 10,000 to
50‚000 men..
