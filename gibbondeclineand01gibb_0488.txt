to secure the obedience of Maximian, he exaeted from him
either a general affurance that he would submit his actions to the

authority of his benefactor, or a particular promise that he would
descend from the throne, whenever he should receive the advice

and the example. This engagement, though it was confirmed
by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline
Jupiter ¹¹⁰, would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce tem-

neither defired present tranquillity nor future reputation. But
he yielded, however reluctantly, to the ascendant which his
wiser colleague had acquired over fhim, and retired, immediately

princes to whom he had resigned the poffeflion of the world ¹¹¹.
