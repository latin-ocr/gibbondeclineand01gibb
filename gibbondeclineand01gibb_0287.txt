O'F'THE ROMAN EMPIRE. ‚ 269

the house and family, the management of the land and cattle, were C HD? P.
delegated to the old and the infirm, to women and ssaves. The μ-νῆι
lazy warrior, destitute of every art that might employ his leisure
hours, consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of
sseep and food. And yet, by a wonderful diversity of Nature, (ac-
cording to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest
necesses), the same barbarians are by turns the most indolem and the
most restless of mankind. They delight in ssoth, they detcst tran-
quillity ³⁰. The languid soul, oppreffed with its own weight, anxi-
oussy required some new and powerful sensation 3 and war and dan-
ger were the only amusements adequare to its fierce temper. The
found that summoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear.
It roused him from his uneomfortable lethargy‚ gave him an 36ὶίνο
pursuit‚ and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent emotions of
the mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his existence. In·
the dull intervals of peace, these barbarians were immoderately ad-
dieted to deep gaming and exceffive drinking3 both of which, by
*different means, the one by inflaming their paffions, the other by
extinguishing their reason, alike relieved them from the pain of
thinking. They gloried in paffing whole days and nights 31 13οΙος
and the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous
and drunken affemblies ³¹. Their debts of honour (for in that light
they have transmitted to us those of play) they discharged with
the most romantio fidelity. The desperate gamester, who had staked
his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice, patiently submitted
to the decision of fortune, and suffered himself to be bound, chas-
tised‚ and sold into remote ssavery‚ by his weaker but more lucky
antagonistffi
