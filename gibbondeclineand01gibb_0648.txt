THE DECLlNE AND FALL

But they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the
temples of those ancient heroes, who, in the infancy of the world„
had invented arte, instituted laws, and vanquilhed the tyrants or
monsters who infested the earth ; in order to choose for the exclusive
obje& of their religious worship, an obscure teacher, who, in-a
recent age, and among a barbarous people‚ had fallen a sacrifice ,
either to the malice of his own countrymen‚ or to the jealousy of
the Roman government. The Pagan multitude, reserving their
gratitude for temporal benefits alone, rejected the inestimable present
of life and immortality, which was offered to mankind by Jesus of
Nazareth. His mild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary
sufferings, his universal benevolence, and the sublime simplicity ofhis
affions and character, were insufficient, in the opinion of those
carnal men, to compensate for the want of fame, of empire, and
of success3 and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupen-
dous triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave, they
misrepresented, or they insulted, the equivocal birth, wandering
life, and ignominious death, of the divine Author of Christia-
nity ¹³.

The personal guilt which every Christian had contraCted, in thus
preferring his private sentiment to the national religion, was aggra-
vated in a very high degree by the number and union of the crimi-
nals. It is well known, and has been already observed‚ that Roman
policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any affociation
among its subject& and that the privileges of private corporations,
though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposeS, were be-
stowed with a very sparing hand ¹4. The religious affemblies of the
