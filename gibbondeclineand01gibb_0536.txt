Ctrqeltty of The vanquished emperor left behind him two children, a boy of

Ltcrmus. about eight, and a girl of about seven, years old. Their inoffenfive
age might have excited compassion, but the compassion of Licinius*
was a very feeble resource, nor did it restrain him from extinguishing
the name and mernory of his adversary. The death of Severianus
will admit of less excuse, as it was dietated neither by revenge‘

nor by policy. The conqueror had never received any injury from
the father of that unhappy youth, and the short and obscure reign·
of Severus in a distant part of the empire was already forgotten. But
the execution of Candidianus was an act of the blackest cruelty and·
ingratitude. He was the natural son of Gal-erius, the friend and bene-
fae’tor of Licinius. The prudent father had judg-ed him too young to
fustain the weight ofadiadem3 but he hoped that under the protectior}
of princes, who were indebted to his favour for the Imperial purple,
Candidianus might pass a secure and honourable life. He was now
advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty
of his birth, though unsupported either by merit or ambition,
was sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind> of Licinius ⁸⁰. To
these innocent and illustrious viCtims of his tyranny, we must add·
the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian. When that
prince conferred on Galerius the title os Caesar, he had given him in
marriage his daughter Valeria, whose melancholy adventures might
