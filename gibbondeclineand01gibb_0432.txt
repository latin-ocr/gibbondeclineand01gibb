THE DECLINE AND FALL

before they were contradiaed by his death3 an event attended with
such ambiguous circumstances, that it may best be related in a
letter from his own secretary to the praefect of the city. ‘⁶ Caruss
says he, “ our dearest emperor, was confined by sickness to his bed,
“ when a furious tempest arose in the camp. The darkness which
“ overspread the {ky was so thick, that we could no longer dis-
“ tinguish each other3 and the inceffant flasties of lightning took
⁴‘ from us the knowledge of all that paffed in the general confusion.
‘⁶ Immediately after the most violent clap of thunder, we heard a
“ sudden cry, that the emperor was dead; and it soon appeared,
“ that his chamberlains, in a rage of grief, had set fire to the royal
‘⁸ paviliion, a circumstance which gave rise to the report that Carus
“ was killed by lightning. But as far as we have been able to iri-,-
“ vestigate the nuth, his death was the natural effect. of his dis.-
“ order⁷⁶.'’

The vacaney of the throne was not productive of any disturbance.
The ambition of the aspiring generals was checked by their mu·-
tual fears, and young Numerian, with hist absent brother Carinus,
were unanimoussy acknovvledged as Roman emperors. The public
expe&ed that the successor- of Carus would pursue his father's foot-
steps, and, without allowing the Perfians to recover from their con.-
sternation, would advance sword in hand to the palaces of Susa and
Ecbatana ⁷⁷.. But! the legions, however strong in numbers and dis-
cipline, were dismayed by the most abjeci superstition. Notwith-
flanding all the arts- that were practised to disguise the manner of the
late emperor’s death, it was found impoffible to remove the opinion
of the multitude, and the power of opinion isirrefistible.> Places os
persons struck with lightning were confidered by the ancients with,
