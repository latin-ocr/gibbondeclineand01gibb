THE DECLINE AND FALL

had elevated his new kinsman to the rank of Caesar. According to
the system of government instituted by Diocletian, Italy, and per-
haps Africa, were defigrned for his department in the empire.
But the performance of the promised favour was either attended
with so much delay, or accompanied with so many unequal con-
ditions‚ that the fidelity of Baffianus was alienated rather than
secured by the honourable distinction which he had obtained. His
nomination had been ratified by the consent of Licinius, and that
artful prince, by the means of his emissaries, soon contrived to
enter into a secret and dangerous correspondence with the new
Caesar, to irritare his discontents, and to urge him to the rash

enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit
from the justice of Constantine. But the vigilant emperor dis-
covered tbe conspiracy before it was ripe for execution ; and, after
solemnly renouncing the alliance of Baflianus‚ despoiled him of the
purple, and inflieted the deserved punishment on his treason and
ingratitude. The haughty refusal of Licinius, when he was required ⁷
to deliver up the criminals, who had taken refuge in his dominions,
confirmed the suspicions already entertained of his perfidy; and the
indignities offered at AEmbna, on the frontiers of Italy, to the
statues of Constantine, became the signal of discord between the two
princes ²³⁷.

The first battle was fought near Cibalis, a city of Pannonia,
situated on the river Save, about fifty miles above Sirmium ²³⁸. From

gest a conjeeture. As it lay to the north-east
of the Julian Alps, that important territory
became a natural ehje& of dispute between
the sovereigns of Italy and of Illyricum.
