OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the inconfiderable forces which in this important contest two such
powersul monarchs brought into the field, it may be inserted, that
the orie was suddenly provokcd‚ and that the other was unexpetfit-
edly surprised. The emperor of the West had only twenty thou-
sand, and the sovereign of the East no more than five and thirty
thousand, men. The inferiority os number was, however, com-
pensated by the advantage of the ground. Constantine had taken
,post in a defile about half a mile in breadth, between a steep hill
and a deep morasS, and in that fituation he stcadily expected aud
repulsed the first attack of the enemy. He pursued his success,
and advanced into the plain. But the veteran legions of Illyricum
rallied under the standard of a leader who had been trained to arms
in the school of Probus and Diocletian. The miffile weapons 011
both fides were soon exhausted ; the two armies, with equal valour,
rushed to a closer engagement of swords and spears, aud the doubt-
ful contest had already lastcd from the dawn of day to a late hour
of the evening, when the right wing, which Constantine led in
person, made a vigorous and decifive charge. The judicious retreat
of Licinius saved the remainder of his troops from a total defeat;
but when he computed his loss, which amounted to more than
twenty thousand men, he thought it unsafe to pass the night in the
presence of an active and victorious enemy. Abandoning his camp
and magazines‚ he marched away with secrecy and diligence at the
head of the greatest part of his cavalry, and was soon removed be-
yond the danger of a pursuit. His diligence preserved his wife,
his son, and his treasures‚ which he had deposxted at Sirmium.
Licinius paffed through that city, and breaking down the bridge on
the Save, hastened to colle& a new army in Dacia and Thrace. In
his flight he bestowed the precarious title of Caesar on Valens, his
*general of the Illyrian frontier ²³⁹.
