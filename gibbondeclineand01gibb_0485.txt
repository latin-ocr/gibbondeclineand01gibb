OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

‘ filled the different departments of the state, was multiplied beyond

the example of former times; and (if we may borrow the warm ex-
preffion of a contemporary), ‘⁶ when the proportion of those who
“ received, exceeded the proportion of those who contributed, the
“ provinces were oppreffed by the weight of tributes ‘⁰⁴2’ From this
period to the extinction of the empire‚ it would be easy to deduce
an uninterrupted series of clamours and complaints. According
to his religion and situation, each writer chuses either Diocle-
tian, or Constantine, or Valens, or Theodosius, for the object of
his invefiives ; but they unanimoussy agree in *representing the bur-
den of the public impositione, and particularly the land—tax and
capitation, as the intolerable and increafing grievance of their own
times„ From such a concurrence, an impartial historian who is
obliged to extra& truth from satire as wellas from panegyric, will
be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they ac-
cuse, and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices,
than to the uniform* system of their administration. The emperor
Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but during his
reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty
and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of establilhing per-
nicious precedents‚ rather than of exercifing adiual oppreflion ¹⁰⁵. It
may be added, that his revenues were managed with prudent oeco-
nomy3 and that after all the current expences were discharge&
there still remained in the Imperial treasury an ample provision ei-
ther for judicibus liberality or for any emergency of the state.

It was in the twenty-first year of his reign that Diocletian exe-
cuted his memorable resolution of abdicating the empire; an action

more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger
