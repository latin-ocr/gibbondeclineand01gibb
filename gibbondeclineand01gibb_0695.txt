courts, had insinuated himself into the favour of Zenobia, he main—
tained above four years the possession of the episcopal house and
office. The vidtory of Aurelian changed the face of the East, and
the two contending parties, who applied to each other the epithets
of schism and heresy, were either commanded or permitted to plead
their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror. This public aud
very singular trial affords a convincing proof, that the existence,
the property, the privileges, and the internal policy‚ of the Christiane
were acknowledged, if not by the laws, at least by the magistrates
of the empire. As a Pagan and as a soldier, it could scarcely be

expetited that Aurelian should enter into the discussion, whether the'

sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most agreeable to
the true standard of the orthodox saith. His determination, however,
was founded on the general principles of equity and reason. He
considered the bishops of Italy as the most impartial and respectable
judges among the Christians, and as soon as he was informed, that
they had unanimoussy approved the sentence of the council, he ac-
quiesced in their opinion, and immediately gave orders that Paul
should be compelled to relinquish the temporal poffeffions belonging
to· an office, of which, in the judgment of his brethren, he had
been regularly deprived. But while we applaud the justice, we should
not overlook the policy‚ of Aurelian ς who was defu-ons of restoring
and cementing the dependance of the provinces on the capital, by
every means which could bind the interest or prejudices of any part
’of his subje&s ¹³⁰.
