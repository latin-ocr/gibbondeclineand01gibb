THE DECLINE AND FALL

vinces were disposed to allow them a primacy of order and affocia-
tion (such was their very accurate expreffion) in the Christian aris·
tocracy¹²⁴. But the power of a monarch was rejected with ab·
horrence, and the aspiring genius of Rome experienced from the
nations of Asia and Africa, a more vigorous refistance to her spiri-
tual, than she had formerly done to her temporal‚ dominion. The
patriotic Cypriam, who ruled with the most absolute sway the church
of Carthage and the provincial synode, opposed with resolution and
success the ambition of the Roman pontiff, artfully connected his
own cause with that of the eastern bishops, and, like Hannibal,
fought out new allies in the heart of Afia'²⁵. If this Punic war
was carried on without any effufion of blood, it was owing much
less to the moderatiori than to the weakness of the contending pre-
lates. Inveffives and excommunicatione were their only weapons;
and these, during the progress of the whole controversy, they
hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion. The hard
necessity of censuring either a pope, or a saint and martyr, distreffes
the modern catholics whenever they are obliged to relate the par·
ticulars of a dispute‚ in which the champions of religion indulged
such pasfions as seem much more adapted to the senate or to the
camp¹²⁶.

The progress of the ecclefiastical authority gave birth to the me·-
morable distinetion of the laity and of the clergy, which had been
unknown to the Greeks and Romans'²⁷. The former of these
appellations comprehend the body of the Christian people; the
