of a misfortune‚ might intercept his retreat. Ruricius Pompeianus,
a general distinguished by his valour and ability, had under his
command the city of Verona, and all the troops that were stationed
in the province of Venetia: As soon as he was informed that Con-
stantine was advaneing towards him, he detaehed a large body of
cavalry, which was defeated in an engagement near Brescia‚ and
pursued by the Gallie legions as far as the gates of Verona. The
neeeffity, the importanee‚ and the difficulties of the siege of Verona,
immediately presented themselves to the sagacious mind of Con·
stamine ⁵⁷. The city was aecessible only by a narrow peninsula to-
wards the west, as the other three fides were surrounded by the
Adige, a rapid river which covered the province of Venetia, from
whence the besieged derived an inexhaustible supply of men and
provisions. It was not without great difficulty, and after several
fruitless attemptS, that Constantine found means to pass the river
at some distance above the city, and in a place where the torrent
was less violent. He then encompaffed Verona with strong lines,
pushed his attacks with prudent vigour, and repelled a desperate
sally of Pompeianus. That·intrepid general, when he had used
every means of defence that the strength of the place or that of the
garrison could afford‚ seeretly escaped from Verona, anxious not for

soon colle&ed an army sufficient either to meet Constantine in the
field, or to attaek him if he obstinately remained within his lines.
