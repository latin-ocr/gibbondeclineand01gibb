THE DECLINE AND FALL

strangers that filled the streete· of R0me; a servile populace, as de-
void of spirit as destitute of property. The defenders of the state,
selected from the flower of the Italian youth ὃ, and trained in the
exercise of arms and virtue, vvere the genuine representatives of the
people, and the best entitled to ele& the military chief of the re-
public. These affertions, however defedtive in reason, became un-
answerable, when the fierce Praetorians increased their weight, by
throwing, like the barbarian conqueror of Rome, their svvords into
the scale ⁹.

The Praetorians had violated the sanCtity of the throne, by the
atrocious murder of Pertinax3 they dishonoured the majesty of
it, by their subsequent condrust. The camp was without a leader,
for even the praese& Laetus, who had excited the tempest‚ prudently
declined the public indignation. Amidst the wild disorder Sulpi·
cianus, the emperor’s father-in·law‚ and governor of the city, who
had been sent to the camp on the first alarm of mutiny, was en-
deavouring to calm the fury of the multitude, when he was filenced
by the clamorous return of the murderers, bearing on a lance the
head of Pertinax. Though history has accustomed us to observe
every principle and every paffion yielding to the imperious dietates
of ambhion, it is scarcely credible that, in these moments of horror,
Sulpicianus lhould have aspired to ascend a throne polluted with the
recent blood of so near a relation, and so excellent a prince. He had
already begun to use the only effeetual argument, and to treat for
the Imperial dignity3 but the more prudent of the Praetorians, ap-
prehenslve that, in this private contradi, they should not obtain a
just price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts;
