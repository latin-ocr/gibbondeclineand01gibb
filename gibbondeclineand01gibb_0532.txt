c-qffia ‘the property of the people, both in Italy and in Africa⁷². The

first tIme that Constantine honoured the senate with his presence,
he recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration,
affured that illustrious order of his smeere regard, and promised
to re-establish its ancient dignity and privileges. The grateful
senate repaid these unmeaning profeffions by the empty titles of
honour, which it was yet in their power to bestow3 and without
presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine, they paffed a
decree to affign him the first rank among the three Augusti who
governed the Roman world ⁷³. Games and festivals were instituted
to preserve the fame of his victory, and several edifices raised
at the expence of Maxentius, were dedicated to the honour of
his successful rival. The triumphal arch of Constantine still re-
mains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arm, and a singular
testimony of the meanest vanity. As it was not posfible to find in the
capital of the empire, a sculptor who was capable of adorning that
public monument; the arch of Trajan, without any respect either
for his memory or for the rules of propriety, was stripped of its
most elegant figures. The difference of times and persons, of
affions and characters, was totally disregarded. The Parthian
captives appear prostrate at the feet of a prince who never carried

his arms beyond the Euphrate53 and curiOuS antiquarians can still -
discover the head of Trajan on the trophies of Constantine. The
new ornaments which it was necessary to introduce between the va-
cancies of ancient sculpture, are executed in the rudest and most
unskilful manner ⁷⁴.
