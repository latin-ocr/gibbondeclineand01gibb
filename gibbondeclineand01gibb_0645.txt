cestors. The voice of oracles, the precepts of philosophcrs, and the
authority of the laws, unauimoussy enforced this national obligation.
By their lofty claim of superior sanctity, the Jews might provoke
the Polytheists to consider thern as an odious and impure race. By
disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their
contempt. The laws of Moses might be for the most part frivolous
or absurd; yet since they had been received during many ages by a
large society, his followers werejustified by the example of mankind;
and it was universally acknowledged‚ that they had a right to prac-

this principle which protected the Jewish synagogue, afforded not
any favour or security to the primitive church. By cmbracing the
faith of the Gospel, the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an
unnatural and unpardonable offence. They diffolved the sacred ties
of custom and educatum, violated the religious infl‘ttutions of their
country, and presumptuoussy despised whatever their fathers had
believed as true, or had reverenced as sacred. Nor was this apostacy
(if we may use the expression) merely of a partial or local kind3
since the pious deferrer who withdrew himself from the ternples of
Egypt or Syria, would equally disdain to secl< an asylum in those
of Athens or Carthage. Every Christian rejetsted with contempt the
superstitious of his family, his city, and his province. The whole
body of Christians unanimoully refused to hold any communion with
the gods of Rome, of the empire‚' and of mankind. It was in vain
that the oppreffed believer afferted the inalienable rights of con-
science and private judgment. Though his situation might excite
„the pity, his arguments could never reach the understanding, either
of the philosophie or of the believing part of the Pagan world.

individuals should entertain scruples against complying with the
