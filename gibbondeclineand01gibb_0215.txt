OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

aud condu& of Augustus. It is not easy to determine whether, on
this occasion, he a&ed as the common father of the Roman world,
or as the oppressor of liberty ; whether he wished to relieve the pro-
vinces, or to impoverish the senate and the equestrian order. But
no sooner had he affumed the reins of government, than he fre-
quently intimated the insufficiency of the tributes‚ and the necessity
of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon
Rome and Italy. In the prosecution of this unpopular design, he
advanced‚ however, by cautious and well-weighed steps. The in-

must have gradually establissied itself. It has been already observed,
that as the wealth of the provinces was attrasted to the capital by
the strong hand of conquest and power3 so a considerable part of it was
restored to the industrious provinces by the gentle influence of com-

and in whatsoever manner the law was expreffed, it was the Roman
purchaser‚ and not the provincial merchant, who paid the tax97.
The rate of the customs varied from the eighth to the fortieth part
of the value of the commodity3 and we have a right to suppose
that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy:
that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on those
of necessity, and that the productioris raised or manufaclured by the
labour of the subjec'ts of the empire, were treated with more in-
dulgence than was shewn to the perniciosis, or at least the unpopular,
