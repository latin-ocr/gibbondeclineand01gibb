he accuses them of adoring' Barth, water, Fire, the Winds, and
the Sun and Moon. But the Perfians of every age have denied the
charge, and explained the eqnivocal conduct, which might appear
to give a colour to it. The elements, and more particularly Fire,
Light‚ and the Sun, whom they called Mithra, were the objefts of
their religious reverence, because they considered them as the purest
symbols, the noblest productions‚ and the most powerful agents of
the Divine Power and Nature ¹³.

Every mode of religion, to make a deep and lasting impreffiou on Ceremonies

the human mind, must exercise our obedience, by enjoining prastices
of devotion, forwhich we can affign no reason3 and must acquire
our esteem, by inculcating moral duties analogous to the dic'tates of
our own hearts. The religion of Zoroaster was abundantly provided
with the former, and poffeffed a sufficient portion of the latter. At
the age of puberty, the faithful Perfian was invested with a mys-
terious girdle‚ the badge of the divine protec‘tion3 and from that
moment, all the actions of his life, even the most indifferent, or
the most necessary, were sanfiified by their peculiar prayerS, ejacula-
tions, or genuflexion33 the omiffion of which, under any circum·
stances,¹ was a grievous sm, not inferior in guilt to the violation of
the moral duties. The moral duties, however, ofjustice, mercy, li-
berality, &c. were in their turn required of the disciple of zoroaster,
who wished to escape the persecution of Ahriman‚ and to live with
Ormusd in a blissful eternity, where the degree of felicity will be

exaCtly proportionecl to the degree of virtue and piety ¹4.
