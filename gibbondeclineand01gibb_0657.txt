OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the course of a few year8‚ produced a new city, more regular and
more beautiful than the former. But all the prudence and huma-
nity affected by Nero on this occasion were insussicient to preserve
him from the popular suspicion. Every crime might be imputed to
the affaffin of his wife and mother ; nor could the princc, who pro...
stituted his person and dignity on the the-atre, be deerned incapable
of the most extravagant tolly. The voice of rumour accuscd the
emperor as the incendiary of his own capital ; and as the most incre·-
dible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people,
it was gravely reported, and firmly believed, that Nem, enjoying
the calamity which he had occasioned, amused himself with finging
to his lyre the destruetion of ancient 'l roy ³⁰. To divert a suspi-
cion, which the power of despotisrn was unable to suppress, the em-
peror resolved to substitute in his own place some fictitious crimi-
nals. “ With this view (continues Tacitus) he inflieted the most

“ exquisite tor-tures on those men, who, under the vulgar appella-

“ tion of Christians, were already branded with deserved infamy.
“ They derived their name and origin from Christ, who in the
‘⁶ reign of Tiberius had suffered death, by the sentence of the pro-
“ curator Pontius Pilate ³¹. For a while, this dire superstition was
“ checked; but it agam burst forth3 and not only spread itself over
“ Judaea, the first seat of this mischievous feet, but was even intro-

“ duced into Rome, the common asylum which receives and pro-

30 We may observe, that the rumour is
mentioned by Tacitus with a very becoming
distrust and hesitation, whilst it is greedily
transcribed by Suetonius, and solemnly con-

firmed by Dion.
³¹ This testimony is alone sufficient to ex-

pose the anachronism of thejews, who place
the birth of Christ near a century sooner (Bas-
nage, Histoire des JuifS, l. v. c. 14, 15·)·
We may learn from Josephnz (Antiquitat.
yviii. 3.), that the procuratorssiip of Pilate

corresponded with the last ten years of Tibe-
riuz, A. D. 27—37. As to the particular
time of the death of Christ, a very early tra-
dition fixed it to the z5th of March, A. D.
29, under the consulship of the two Gemini
(Tertullian adv. Judaeos, c. 8.). This date,
which is adopted by Pagi, cardinal Norris,
and Le Clerc, seems, at least, as probable as
the vulgar aera, which is placed (1 know not
from what conjectures) four years later.
