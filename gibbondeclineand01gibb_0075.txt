oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

whilst the sovereignty of the people was represented in the ma-
jestic edifices destined to the public use ⁷¹ ; nor was this republican
spirit totally extinguilhed by the introduffion of wealth and mo-
narchy. It was in works of national honour and benefit, that
the most virtuous of the emperors affeeted to display their magni-
ficence. The golden palace of Nero excited a just indignation‚ but
the vast extent of ground which had been usurped by his selfish
luxury, was more nobly filled under the succeeding reigns by the
Coliseum, the baths of Titus, the Claudian portico, and the temples
dedicated to the goddess of Peace and to the genius of Rome ⁷².
These monuments of architesture‚ the property of the Roman peo-
-ple, were adorned with the most beautiful produ<ffions of Grecian

painting and sculpture; and in the temple of Peace, a very curious

library was open to the curiosity of the learned. At a small dis-
tance from thence was fituated the Forum of Trajan. It was sur-

rounded with a lofty portico, in the form of a quadrangle, into
which four triumphal arches opened a noble and spacious entrance:
in the centre arose a column of marble, whose height, of one hun-
·dred and ten feet, denoted the elevation of the hill that had been
cut away. This column, which still subfists in its ancient beauty,
exhibited an exa& representation of the Dacian victories of its
founder. The veteran soldier contemplated the story of his own
campaigns, and by an easy illusron of national vanity‚ the peaceful
citizen affociated himself to the honours of the triumph. All the
other quarters of the capital, and all the provinces of the empire,
