OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

subfisted, as an independent state, from the time of the Peloponnelian
war ⁹⁸, was at last swallowed up by the ambition of lviidiridates ⁹⁹,
and with the rest of his dominions‚ sunl< under the weight of
the Roman arms. From the reign of Augustus ¹⁰⁰, the kings of
- Bosphorus were the humble, but not useless, allies of the em-
pire. By presents, by arms, and by a ssight fortification drawn
across the Isthmus, they effectually guarded against the roving
plunderers of Sarmatia, the access of a country, which, from its
peculiar situation and convenient harbours, commanded the Euxine
sea and Asia Minor ¹⁰¹. As long as the sceptre was poffeffed by a
lineal sueceffion of kings, they acquitted themselves of their import-
ant charge with vigilance and success. Domeflic fafitions, and the
feam, or private interest, os obscure usurpem, who seized on the

⁷ vacant throne, admitted the Goths into the heart of Bosphorus.

With the acquisition of a superfluous waste of fertile soil, the con-
querors obtained the command of a naval force, sufficient to trans·-
port their armies to the coast of Asia ¹⁰². The ships used in the
navigation of the Euxine were of a very singular construcffion.
They were ssight flat-bottomed barks framed of timber only, with-
out the least mixture of iron, and occasionally covered with a
shelving roof, on the appearance of a tempest ¹⁰³. ln these floating
houses, the Goths carelessly trusted themselves to the mercy of an
unknown sea, under the condu& of sailors pressed into the service,
and whose sszill and fidelity were equally suspicions. But the hopes
of plunder had banished every idea of danger, and a natural sear-
leffness of temper supplied in their minds the more rational confidence‚
