THE DECLINE AND FALL

II. It is the undoubted right of every society to exclude from
its communion and benefits, such among its members as reject or
violate those regulations which have been established by general con-
sent. In the exercise of this power, the censures of the Christian
church were chiefly directed against scandalous smnerssand par-

on his character a mark of disgrace, he was shunned or suspected

by the generality of mankind. The situation of these unfortunate
exiles was in itself very painful and melancholy3 but, as it usually

happens, their apprehenfions far exceeded their sufferings. The
benefits of the Christian communion were those of eternal life, nor

ecclefiastical governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity
had committed the keys of Hell and of Paradise. The heretics,

the true path of salvation‚ endeavoured to regain, in their separate

affemblies, those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they

no longer derived from the great society of Christians. But
