OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

been invested with the honours of the consulship, and had formed
very numerous connexioms with every order of men, both in Italy
and in the provinces. From his ignorance therefore we may derive
some useful information. We may affure ourselves, that when he
accepted the government of Bithynia, there were no general laws
or decrees of the senate in force against the Christians; that neither
Trajan nor any of his virtuous predecessors‚ whose ediCts were re-
ceived into the civil and criminal jurisprudence‚ had publickly
declared their intentions concerning the new sect3 and that what-
ever proceedings had been carried on against the christiam, there
were none of sufficient weight and authority to establish a precedent
for the condu& of a Roman magistrate.

The answer of Trajan, to which the Christians of the succeeding
age have frequently appealed‚ discovers as much regard for justice
and humanity as could be reconciled with his mistaken notions
o'f religious policy ⁵⁹. Instead of displaying the implacable zeal of
an inquisitor, anxious to discover the most minute particles of
heresy, and exulting in the number of his victims, the emperor
expresses much more solicitude to prote& the security of the in-
nocent, than to prevent the escape of the guilty. He acknowledges
the difficulty of fixing any general plan; but he lays down two
salutary mles, which often afforded relief and support to the
distreffed Christiane. Though he directe, the magistrates to punish
such persons as are legally convicte& he prohibite them, with
a very humane inwnststency, from making any inquiries concern-
ing the supposed criminals. Nor was the magistrate allowed to
γ proceed on every kind of information. Anonymous charges the
emperor rejects, ‚as too repugnant to the equity of his government3
