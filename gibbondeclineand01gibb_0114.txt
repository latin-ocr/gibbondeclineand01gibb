96 THE DECLINE AND FALL

, C PIIHA P· If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world,

ι-Ὓ--Δ during which the condition of the human race was most happy and

ffiifffiliiziixssf prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed
from the death of Domitian to the acceffion of Commodus. The
vast extent of the Roman empire was governed by absolute power,
under the guidance of virtue and wisdom. The armies were
restrained by the firm but gentle hand of four successive emperors,

of their people. The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws

might serve to display the virtues, but could never corre& the
vices, of the emperor. The military force was a blind and irre-

fistible instrument of oppreffion3 and the corruption of Roman
manners would always supply flatterers eager to applaud, and mi-

nisters prepared to serve, the fear or the avarice, the lust or the
cruelty, of their masters.
