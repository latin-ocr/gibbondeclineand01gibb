appeared to the Pagans, suchaecriminah obstinacy. The ancient k--v--J

apologists of Christianity have censured, with equal truth and
severity, the irregular condu& of their persecutors‚ who, contrary
to every principle of judicial proceeding, admitted the use of tortum,
in order to obtain, not a confession, but a denial, of the crime which
was the objec‘t of their inquiry ⁶⁴. The monks of succeeding ages,
who, in their peaceful solitudes, entertained themselves with di-
verfifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyre„ have
frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious
nature. In particular, it has pleased thern to suppose, that the
zeal of the Roman magistrates, disdaining every consideration of
moral virtue or public decency, endeavoured to seduce those whom
they were unable to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal
violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible 'to seduce.
It is related, that pious females, who were prepared to despise death,
were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial, and called upon to
determine whether they set a higher value on their religion or on their
chastity. The youths to whose licentious embraces -they were aban-
doned, received a solemn exhortation from the judge, to exert their
most strenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus against the
impious virgin who refused tovburn incense on her altars. Their
violence however was commonly disappointed‚ and the seasonable
interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses
of Christ from the dishonour even of an involuntary defeat. We
should not indeed neglect to remark, that the more ancient as well
as authentie memorials of the chnrch are seldom polluted with these
extravagant and indecent fiCtions ⁶⁵.
