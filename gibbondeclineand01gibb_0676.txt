His banish-
ment.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

of his martyrdom has been recorded with unusual candour and
impartiality. A short abstra& therefore of its most important cir-
cumstances will convey the clearest information of the spirit, and of
the forms, of the Roman persecutions ⁸⁰.

When Valerian was consul for the third, and Gallienus for the
fourth, time; Paternus, proconsul of Africa, summoned Cyprian
to appear in his private council-chamber. He there acquainted him
with the Imperial mandate which he had just received ²³¹, that those
who had abandoned the Roman religion should immediately return
to the praCtice of the ceremonies ‘of their ancestors. Cyprian replied
without hesitation, that he was a Christian and a bishop, devoted to
the worship of the true and only Deity‚ to whom he offered up his
daily supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two emperors,
his lawful sovereigns. With modest confidence he pleaded the pri-
vilege of a citizen, in refusing to give any answer to some invidious
and indeed illegal questions which the proconsul had proposed. A
sentence of banishment was pronouneed as the penalty of Cyprian's
disobedience ; and he was condueted without delay to Curubis, a free
and maritime city of Zeugitania, in a pleasant situation, a fertile
territory, and at the distance of about forty miles from Carthage ⁸².

²0 We have an original lise of Cyprian by
the deacon Pontius, the companion of his
exile, and the spesstator of his death; and
we likewise possess the ancient proconsular
afts of his martyrdom. These two relations
are consistent with each other, and with pro-
bability ς and what is somewhat remarkable,
they are both unsullied by any miraculous cir-
cumstances.

θ’ It should seem that these were circular
orders, sent at the same time to all the go-
vernors. Dionysius (ap. Euseb. l. vii. c. 11.)
relatos the history of his own bauishment from
Alexandria, almost in the same manner. But
as he escaped and survived the persecution,
we must account him either more or less for-

tunate than Cyprian.

Geograph. Antiq. part iii. p. 96. Shaw's
Travels, p. 90.; and for the adjacent coun-
try (which is terminated by Cape Bona, or
the promontory of Mercury) l'Afrique de
Marmol. torn. ii. p. 474. There are the re·-
mains of an aquedu&‚ near Curubis, or Cur-
bis, at present altered into Gurbes3 and Dr.
Shaw read an inscription, which st>⁷les that
city, Colonia Fulvia. The deacon Pontius
(in Vit. Cyprian. c. 12.) calls it “ Apricum
et competentem locum, hospitium pro volun-
tate secretum, et quicquid apponi eis ante
promissum est, qui regnum et justitiam Dei
quaertint.⁷'
