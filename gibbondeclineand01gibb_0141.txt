OF THE RoMA‘N EMPIRE.

the coffeis of the prince3 the rapaciousness of Commodus had been
so very inadequate to his extravagance, that, upon his death, no
more than eight thousand pounds were found in the exhausted trea-
sury ⁵⁰, to defray the current expences of government‚ and to dis-
charge the preffing demand of a liberal donative, which the new
emperor had been obliged to promise to the Praetorian guards. Yet
under these distreffed circumstances, Pertinax had the generous firm-
ness to remit all the oppreffive taxes, invented by Commodus, and
to cancel all the unjust claims of the treasury 3 declaring in a decree
of the senate, “ that he was better satisfied to administer a poor re-
“ public with innocence, than to acquire riches by the ways of ty-
“ ranny and difflonour.” Oeconomy and industry he considered as
the pure and genuine sources of wealth5 and from them he soon
derived a copious supply for the public neceffities. The expence of
the household was immediately reduced to one half. All the instru-
ments of luxury, Pertinax exposed to public auction ⁵¹, gold and
filver plate‚ chariots of a singular construction, a superfluous ward*
robe of silk and embroidery‚ and a great number of beautiful ssaves
of both sexes ; excepting only, with attentive humanity, those who
were born in a state of freedorn, and had been ravished from the
arms of their weeping parents. At the same time that he obliged
the vvorthless favourites' of the tyrant to resign a part of their ill-
gotten wealth, he satisfied the just creditors of the state, and unex-
pec‘tedly discharged the long arrears of honest services. He removed
the oppreffive restriffions which had been laid upon commerce‚ and
granted all the uncultivated lands in Italy and the provinces, to those

⁵0 Decies. The blameless oeconomy of useless ornaments into money, Dion (l.lxxiii.
