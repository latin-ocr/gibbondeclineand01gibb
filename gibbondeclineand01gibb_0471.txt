OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

(ὗ comes the Pei-flans to expatiate 011 the viciffitudes of fortune,
“and calmly to read us locun-es on the virtues of moderation.
“ Let them remember their own moder-atlon towards the unhappy
“ Valerian. They vanquished him by fraud, they treated him
“with indignity. They detained him till the last moment of
‘⁶ his life in :shameful captivity, and after his death they exposed
“ his body to perpetual ignominy.'’ Softening, however, his tone,
Galerius insinuated to the ambaffador‚ that it had never been the
praCtice of the Romans to trample on a prostrate enemy ; and that,
on this occafion, they should consult their own dignhy, rather than
the Perfian merit. He dismissed Apharban with a hope, that
Narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might obtain,
ν from the clemency of the emperors, a lasting peace, and the
restoration of his wives and children. In this conference we may
discover the fierce paffions of Galerius, as well as his deference to
the superior wisdom and authority of Diocletian. The'ambition of
the former grasped at the conquest of the East, and had proposed

to reduce Persia into the state of a province. The prudence of the'

latter, who adhered to the moderate policy of Augustus and the
Antonines, embraced the favourable opportunity of terminating a
successful war by an honourable and advantageous peace ⁷⁵.

In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards
appointed Sicorius Probus, one of their secretarieS‚ to acquaint the
Persian court with their final resolution. As the minister of peace,
he was received with every mark of politeness and friendship ; but,
under the pretence of allowing him the necessary repose after
so l'ong ajourney, the audience of Probus was deferred from day
to day3 and he attended the ssow motions of the king, till at

length he was admitted to his presence, near the river Asprudus‚·
