vince of the Roman world. The dangerous frontier of Rhaetia he so h--v—-d,

firmly secured, that he left it without the suspicion of an enemy. He
broke the wandering power of the Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror
of his arms compelled those barbarians to relinquish their spoil. The
Gothic nation cour-ted the alliance of so warlike an emperor ³⁰. He
attacked the Isaurians in their mountains‚ besieged- and took several·
of their strongest castles ³¹, and flattered himself that he had for ever
suppreffed a domestic foe, whose independence so deeply wounded the·
majesty of the empire. The troubles excited by the usurper Firmus·
in the Upper Egypt, had never been perfeffly appeaffid, and the
cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of¹ the Blem-
myes, still maintained an obscure rebellion. The chastisement of
those ciues, and of their auxiliaries the savages of the south, is said'
to have alarmed the court of Perfia ³², and the great King sued iu
vain for· the friendlhip of Probus. Most of the exploits which dis-'-
tinguished his reign, were atchieved by the personal valour and con-
dustssof the emperor, insomuch that the writer of his life expresses
some amazement how, in so short a time, a single man could be pre-
sent in so many distant wars. The remaining actions he intrusted to
the care of his lieutenants‚ the judicious choice of whom forms no
inconfiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian, Maximian,
Constantius, Galerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd of
other chiefs‚ who afterwards ascended or supported the throne, were
trained to arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus ³³.
