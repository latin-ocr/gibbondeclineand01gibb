abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy saith,
who, by the dim light of legends and traditions, of conjersturea
and etymologies, condufied the great—grandehildren of Noah from the
'so-„ver of Babel to the extremities of the globe. Of these judicious
crines, one of the most entertaining was Olaus Rudbeek, professor
in the university of Upsal ¹⁵. ’ VVhatever is celebrated either in his-
tory or fable‚ this zealous patr-iot ascribes to his country. From
Sweden (which formed so considerable a part of ancient Germany)
the Greeks themselves derived their alphabetieal charaerers, their
astronomy, and their religion. Of that delightful region (for such

tunate lssmds, and even the Elyfian Fields, were all but faint and
