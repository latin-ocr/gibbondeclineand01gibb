in their third naval invasion. The arts of Greece, and the wealth
of Asia, had conspired to ere& that sacred and magnificent firufiure.
It was supported by an hundred and twenty-seven marble columns
of the Ionic order. They were the gifts of devout monarchs, and
each was fixty feet high. The altar was adorned with the masterly
sculptures of Praxiteles, who had, perhaps, selected from the favou-
rite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of Latona,
the concealment of Apollo after the ssaughter of the Cyclop3‚ and
the clemency of Bacchus to the vanquissied Amazons¹²⁹. Yet the

length of the temple of Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty-
five feet, about two—thirds of the measure of the church of St,

Peter’s at Rome ¹³⁰. In the other dimenfions, it was still more in-

ferior to that sublime produd'cion of modern archited'ture. The
spreading arms of a Christian cross require a much greater breadth
than the oblong temples of the Pagans; and the boldest artists of
antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of raising in
the air a dome of the fiZe and proportions of the pantheon. The
temple of Diana was, however, adniired as one of the wonders
of the world. Succeffive empires, the Perfian, the Macedonian,
and the Roman, had revered its sanctity, and enriched its splen-
dour ¹³¹. But the rude savages of the Baltie were destitute ofa taste
for the elegant arts, and they de'spised the ideal terrors of a foreign
superstition ¹³².

Another circumstance is related of these invafions, which might
deserve our notice, were it not justly to be suspected as the fanciful
