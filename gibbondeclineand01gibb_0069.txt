OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ception of modern luxury ⁵⁸. It was more for the interest of the

merchant or manufacturer to purchase‚ than to hire his workmen;
and in the country, ssaves were employed as the cheapest and most
laborious instruments of agriculture. To confirm the general ob-
servation‚ and to display the multitude of ssaves, we might allege a
variety of particular instances. It was discovered, on a very me-
lancholy occasion, that four hundred ssaves were maintained in
a single palace of Rome ⁵⁹. The same number of four hundred
belonged to an estate, which an African widow, of a very private
condition, resigned to her son, whilst she reserved for herself a
much la-rger ssiare of her property ⁶⁰. A freedman, under the reign
of Augustus, though his fortune had suffered great loffes in the
civil wars, left behind him three thousand fix hundred yoke of
oxen, two hundred and fifty thousand head of smaller cattle, and
what was almost included in the description of cattle, four thousand
one hundred and sixteen ssaves ⁶¹.

The number of subjed'ts who acknowledged the laws of Rome,
of citizens, of provincials, and of ssaves, cannot now be fixed with
such a degree of accuracy, as the importance of the objc& would
deserve. We are informed, that when the emperor Claudius ex-
ercised the office of censor, he took an account of fix millions nine
hundred and forty-five thousand Roman citizens, who, with the pro-
portion of women and children, rnust have amounted to about twenty
millions of souls. The multitude of subjths of an inferior rank,
was uncertain and fluituating. But, after weighing with attention
every circumstance which could influence the balance, it seems pro-
bable‚ that there existed, in the time of Claudius, about twice as
many provinciale as there were citizens, of either sex and of every
