period exempt from error and from deceit, to which we might be
disposed to extend the gift of supernatural powers. From the first
of the fathers to the last of the popeS, asucceffion of bistrops, of
saints, of martyrs‚ and of miracles, is continued without interrup-

imperceptible‚ that we know not in what particular link we should
break the chain of tradition. Every age bears testimony to the
wonderful events by which it was distinguished, and its testimony
appears no less weighty and respectable than that of the preceding
generatim, till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own incon-
fistency‚ if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the
venerable Bede, or to the holy Bernard, the same degree of con-

Justin or to Irenaeus ⁸¹. If the truth of any of those miracles is*
appreciated by their apparent use and propriety‚ every age had un-
believers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous nations
to convert3 and sufficient motives might always be produced to
justify the interpofition of Heaven. And yet slnce every friend to
revelation is persuaded of the reality‚ and every reasonable man is
convinced of the cessation, of miraculous powers, 'it is evident that·
