oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the* emperor Hadrian, who had construeted an a-rtificial port on a
coast left destitute by nature of secure harbours ¹⁰⁹. The city was
large and populous; a double enclosure of walls seemcd to defy the
fury of the Goths‚ and the usual garrison had been strengthened by a
reinforcement of ten thousand men. But there are not any advan-
tages capable of supplying the absence of discipline and vigilance.

discovered the supine negligence of the besieged, erected a lofty pile
of fascines, ascended the walls in the silence of the night, and
entered the defenceless city, sword in hand. A general maffacre of
the people ensued, whilst the affrighted soldiers escaped through the
opposite gates of the town. The most holy temples‚ and the most
splendid edifices, were involved in a common destruction. The
booty that fell into the hands of the Goths was immense: the wealth
of the adjacent countries had been depofited in Trebizond, as in a
secure place of refuge. The number of captives was incredible, as
