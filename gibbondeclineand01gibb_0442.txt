Carinus poffeffed arms and treasures sufficient to support his legal
title to the empire. ,But his personal vices overbalanced every
advantage of birth and fituation. The most faithful- servants of the
father despised the incapacity, anddreaded the cruel arrogance, of the
son. The hearts of the people were engaged in favour of his rival,
and even the senate was mclined to prefer an usurpet to a tyrant.
The arts of Diocletian inflamed th'e general discontent; and the
winter was employed in secret intrigues, and open preparations fora

encountered each other in the plains of Margus, a small city' of
Maefia, in the neighbourhood of the Danube ¹⁰⁸. The troops, so
lately returned from the Persian war, had acquired their glory at
the expence of health and numbers, nor were they in a condition to
contend with the unexhausted strength of the legions of Europe.
Their rank-s were broken, and, for a moment, Diocletian despaired
of the purple and of life. But the advantage which Carinus
had obtained by the valour of his soldier-s, he quickly lost by the
infidelity of his officers„ A Tribune, whose wife he had seduced,

guilhed civil discord in the blood of the adulterer ¹⁰⁹.
