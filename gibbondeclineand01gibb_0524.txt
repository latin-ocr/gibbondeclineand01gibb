render Italy almost inaccessible to the enemies of the king of Sar-,

who have attempted the paffage, have seldom experienced any dis-
ficulty or relistance. In the age of Constantine, the peasants of
the mountains were civilized and obedient subje&s ;¹ the country
was plentifully stocked with provifions‚ and the stupendous high- ,
ways which the Romans had carried over the Alps, opened several

communications between Gaul and Italy ⁵⁵. Constantine preferred
the road of the Cottian Alps, or, as it is now called, of Mount
Cenis‚ and led his troops with such afiive diligence, thathe de-
scended into the plain of Piedrnont before the court of Maxentius
had received any certain intelligence of his departure from the
banks of the Rhine. The city of Susa, however, which is fituated
at the foot of Mount Cenis, was stu-founded with walls, and pro-

an invader3 but the impatience of Constantine's troops disdaincd
the tedious forms of a siege. The same day that they appeared be-.

and mounting to the affault amidst a ssiower of stones and arrows,
they entered the place sword in hand, and cut in pieces the greatest
