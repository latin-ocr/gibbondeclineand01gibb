Another invasion of the Alemanni, of a more f<5›rinidal›l: aspefr, ⁵ ”

but more glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower ein—

pire. Three hundred thousand ol' that war-like people are said to «

have been vanquissied, in a battle near Milan, by Gallicini} in pu<-
son, at the head of only ten thousand l{<')1iia1]s'³‘. 'We may lion-:—
ever, with great probability, ascribe this incredible viclory, either {o
the credulity of the historiam, or to some exaggeraret] cxploita of one
of the emperor's lieutenants. It was by arms of a very different
nature, that Gallienus endeavoured to prote& Italy from the fury of
the Germans. He espoused Pipa the daughter of a king of tlte
Marcomanni, a Suevic tribe, which was often confoundcd with th:
Alemanni in their wass and conquest59². To the father, as tlie.
price of his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia.
The native charms of unpolissied beauty seem to have fixed the
daughter in the affeffions of the inconstant emperor, and the hamis
of poiicy were more lirmly connefiied by those of love. {ut ilie
hauglity prejudice of Rome ssill refused the name of marriage, [11
the profane mixture of a citizen and a barbarian ; and lias stigma-

Gallienus ⁹³.

ΙΙΙ. We have already traced the emigration of the Collis from
Scandinavia, or at least from pl‘Ussla, to the mouth of the Bory-
sthenes, and liare followed their victorious arms from the Bory-
ssliencs, to the Danube. Under the rcigns of Valerian and Gallienus
the frontier os the last mentioned river was perpetually infesled by
the inroads of Germans and Sarmatian& but it was defended by
ilie Romans with more than usual sirmnel's and success. Tlie pro-
vinces that were the scat of war, rec-ruited the armies of Rome widi
