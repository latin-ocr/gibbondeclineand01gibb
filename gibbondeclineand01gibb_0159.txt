OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 141

his unfortunate successor. Julian was conducted into a private apart- u-v--e
ment of the baths of the palace, and beheaded as a common criminal, &effigi-and
after having purchased, with an immense treasure‚ an anxious and ἓζὲζξῑὲἓῖῖζ
precatione reign of only sixty-fix days ³⁶. The almost incredible ‘gfff-193.
expedition of Severus, who, in so short a space of time, conducted June 2-
a numerous army from the banks of the Danube to those of the Δ

Tyber, proves at once the plenty of provisions produced by agri-

culture and commerce, the goodness of the roads, the discipline of

the legions, and the indolent subdued temper of the provinces ³⁷.

The first cares of Severus were bestowed on two measures, the ἓέῗῇἱξξοὲξη
one dictated by policy‚ the other by decency ; the revenge, and the guards-
honours, due to the memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor
entered Rome, he iffued his commands to the Praetorian guards,
diresting thern to wait his arrival on a large plain near the city,
without arms, but in the habits of ceremony, in which they were
-accustomed to attend their foyereign. He was obeyed by those
haughty troops, whose contrition was the effect of their just
terrors. A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompaffed them
with levelled spears. Incapable of ssight or refistance, they ex·
pected their fate in filent consternation. Severus mounted the
tribunal, sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice‚ dis-
missed them with ignominy from the trust which they had betrayed,
despoiled them of their splendid ornaments, and banished them,

on pain of death, to the distance of an hundred miles from the
