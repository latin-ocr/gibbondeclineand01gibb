OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The inflammatory powers of art were summoned to his aid: the
confused multitude of women, of wines, and of dissies, and the
studied variety of attitudes and fauces, served to revive his languid

prodigality supplied the want of taste and elegance3 and whilst Ela-
gabalus lavished away the treasures of his people in the wildest ex-
travagance‚ his own voice and that of his flatterers applauded a

spirit and magnificence unknown to the tameness of his predeceffors.‚
To confound the order of seasons and climates ⁵⁷, to sport with the

paffions and prejudices of his sumens, and to subvert every law of
nature and decency, were in the number of his most delicious amuse-
’ ments. A long train of concubines, and a rapid succeflion ofwives‚
among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred

asylum ⁵³, were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of 'nis paslions.
The master of the Roman world affefied to copy the dress and

manners of the female sex, preferred the distaff to the sceptre, and

would have been supplanted by one Zoricm,
had he not contrived, by a porion, to ener⁴
vate the powers of his rival, who being found
on trial uncqual to his reputation, was driven
with ignominy from the palace. Dion, l.

praefcost of the city, acharioteer praefeft of the
warch, a barber praefest of the provisione.
