OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the scienee of tantos was cultivated with success ; and as long as the
empire retained any vigour‚ their military instructions were respezst-
ed, as the most perse& model of Roman discipline.

Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced into the service
many alterations and improvementS. The legions, as they are de·
7 scribed by Polybius ⁴¹, in the time of the Punic wass, dissered very
materially from those which atchieved the vietor-ies of Caesar, or de-
fended the monarchy of Hadrian and the Antonines. The consti-
tution of the Imperial legion may be describedin a few words ⁴². The
heavy-armed infantry, which composed its principal strength ⁴³, was
divided into ten cohorts, and fifty—five companies, under the orders
of a correspondent number of tribunes and centurions, The first
cohort‚ *which always claimed the post of honour and the custody of
the eagle, was formed of eleven hundred and five soldiers, the most
approved for valour and fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts con-
fisted each of five hundred and fifty-five ; and the whole body of
legionary infantry amounted to slx thousand one hundred men.
Their arms were uniform, and admirably adapted to the nature of
their service ε an open helmet, with a lofty crest3 a breast-plate, or
coat of mail; greaves on their legS‚ and an ample buckler on their
left arm. The buckler was of an oblong and concave figure, four feet
in length, and two and a half in breadth, framed of a light wood,
covered with a bull‘s hide, and strongly guarded with plates of

brass. Belides a lighter spear, the legionary soldier grasped in his

right hand the formidablepilum, ξι ponderous javelin, whose utmost
length was about six feet, and which was terminated by a maffy
