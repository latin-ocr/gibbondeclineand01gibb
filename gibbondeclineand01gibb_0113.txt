lucubration. At the age of twelve years he embraced the rigid *οων-θ
system of the Stoice, which taught him to submit his body to hisr-
mind, his pastione to his reason3 to consider virtue as the only
good, vice as the only evil, all things external‚ as things in-
different 4⁶. His meditations, composed in the tumult of a camp,
are still extant3 and he even condescended' to give leffons of philo-›
sophy, inv a more public manner, than was perhaps consistent with·
the modesty of a fage, or the dignity of an emperor ⁴⁷. But his·
life was the noblest commentary on the precepts of Zeno. He was
severe to himself, indulgent to the i1npe1·fec“[ion of others, just and'
beneficent to all mankind. He regretted that Avidius Caffius, who
excited a rebellion in Syria, had disappointed him, by a voluntary
death, of the pleasure of converting an enemy into a friend, and he‘
*justified the sincerity of tha-t sentiment, by moderati'ng the zeaI of
the senate against the adherents of the traitor ⁴⁸. VVar he detested,
as the disgrace and calamity of human nature ; but when the neces-2
fity of a just defence called upon him to take up arms, he readily
exposed his person to eight winter campaignS, on the frozen banks·
of the Danube, the severity of which was at last fatal to the weak-
ness of his constitution. His memory was revered by a grateful'
posterity‚ and above a century after his death, many persons pre-
served the image of Marcus Antoninus among those of thei'r house-

hold gods 4⁹.
