OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE·

The Germans respected only those duties which they imposed on
themselws The most obscure soldier refisted with disdxin the
authority of the magistiffates “ The noblest youths blulhed not
“ to be numbered among the faithful companions of some renow nedm
“ chief, to whom they devoted their arms and service. A noble
“ emulation prevailed among the companions to obtain the first

“ narrow limits of their own tribe. Presents and embasiies solicited
“their friendship, and the fame of their arms often ensured
“ vi&ory to the party which they espoused. In the hour of danger
‘⁶ it was shameful sor the chief to be surpassecl in valour by his
“ companions; shameful for the companions not to equal the
“ valour of their chief. To survive his fall in battle, was indelible
