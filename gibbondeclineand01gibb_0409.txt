discord, and military violence, had inflieted on the constitution,
and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient republic‚ as it had
been preserved by the policy of Augustus, and the virtues of Trajan

„ and the Antonines. It may not be useless to recapitulate some

of the most important prerogatives which the senate appeared to
have regained by the electior] of Tacitus ¹³. 1. To invest one of their
body, under the title of emperor, with the general command of the
armies and the government of the frontier provinces. 2. To
determine the list, οι· as it was then styled‚ the College of Consuls.
They were twelve in number, who, in succeflive pairs, each, during
the space of two months, filled the year, and represented the dignity
of that ancient office. The authority of the senate, in the nomination
of the consuls, was exercised with such independent freedom, that no
regard was paid to an irregular request of the emperor iu favour of
his brother Floria-nus. ‘⁴ The senate,’' exclaimed Tacitus, with the
honest transport of a patriot, ‘⁸ understand the charadier of a prince
“ whom they have chosen.” 3. To appoint the proconsuls and pre-
fidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates their
civil* jurisdiction. 4. To receive appeals through the intermecliate
office of the praefedt of the city from all the tribunals of the empire-
5. To give force and validity, by their decrees, to such as they should
approve of the emperor’s edif‘ts. ί). To these several branches of
authority, we may> add some inspecffion over the finances, since, even
in the stern reign of Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part
of the revenue from the public service ¹⁴.
