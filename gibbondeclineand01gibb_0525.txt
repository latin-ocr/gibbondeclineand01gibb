OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Constantine, and the rem⁹ains of Susa preserved from total destruc-
tion. About forty miles fro-m thence, a more severe contest awaited
him. A numerous army of Italians was assembled under the lieu-
tenants of Maxentius in the plains of Turin. Its principal strength
confisted in a species of heavy cavalry, which the Romam, since
the decline of their discipline, had borrowed from the nations of the
East. The horses, as well as the men, were clothed in complete
armour, the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions
of their bodies. The aspect of this cavalry was formidable‚ their
weight almost irrefistible; and as, on this occasion, theIr generals
had drawn them up in a compa& column or wedge, with a ssiarp
point, and with spreading flanks, they flattered themselves that they
should easily break and trample down the army of Constantine.
They might perhaps have succeeded in their design, had not
their experienced adversary embraced the same method of defenee,
which in similar circumstances had been praCtised by Aurelian.
The skilful evolutions of Constantine divided and baffled this maisy
column of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fied in confusion to-
wards Turin; and as the gates of the city vvere shut against them,
very few escaped the sword of the victorious pursuers. By this
important service, Turin deserved to experience the clemency and
even favour of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial
palace of Milan, and almost all the cities of Italy between the Alps
and the Po not only acknowledged the power, but embraced with
zeal the party, of Constantine ⁵⁶.

From Milan to Rome, the AEmilian and Flaminiar] highways offered
an easy march of about four hundred miles ; but though Constan-
tine was impatient to encounter the tyram, he prudently directed
