OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

hereditary quality ²⁸. The particular causes of calumny and suspi-
cion were at length exhausted3 and when a senator was accused of
being a secret enemy to the government, the emperor was satisfied
with the general proof that he was a man of property and virtue.
From this well-grounded principle he frequently drew the most

The execution of so many innocent citizens was bewailed by the
