OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

a rasti youth ⁵4, but of an ancient and opulent family, listened to the
voice of ambition; and a conspiracy was formed during a short
absence of Pertinax, which was crushed by his sudden return to
Rome, and his resolute behaviour. Falco was on the point of be-
ing justly condemned to death, as a public enemy, had he not been
saved by the earnest and sincere intreaties of the injured emperor;
who conjured the senate, that the purity of his reign might not be
stained by the blood even ofa guilty senator.

These disappointments served only to irritate the rage of the Prae-
torian guards. On the twenty—eighth of March, eighty-fix days
only after the death of Commodus, a general sedition broke out in
the camp, which the officers wanted either power or inclination to
suppress. Two or three hundred of the most desperate soldiers march-
ed at noon-day‚ with arms in their hands, and fury in their looks, to-
wards the Imperial palace. The gates were thrown open by their
companions upon guard; and by the domestics of the old court,
who had already formed a secret conspiracy against the life of the
too virtuous emperor. On the news of their approach, Pertinax
disdaining either ssight or concealment advanced to meet his affaffins3
and recalled to their minds his own innocence, and the sanctity of
their recent oath. For a few moments they stood in sllent suspense,
ashamed of their atrocious defign, and awed by the venerable aspect
and majestic firmness of their sovereign, till at length the despair
of pardon reviving their fury, a barbarian of the country of Tongres ⁴³
levelled the first blow against Pertinax, who was· instantly dispatched

⁵⁴ Ifwe credit Capitolinus (which is rather horse-guards, who were mostly raised in the
difficult) Falco behaved with the most petulant dutchy of Gueldres and the neighbourhood,
indecency to Pertinax, on the day of his ac· and were distinguished by their valonr, and
cellion. The wise emperor only admonished by the boldness with which they swam thcir
