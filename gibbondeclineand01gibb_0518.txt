THE DECLINE AND FALL

year of his reign, Constantine vifited the city of Auum, and gene-
roussy remittcd the arrears of tribute, reducing at the same time the
proportion of their affeffment, from twenty-five to eigh-tcen thousand
heads, subje& to the real and persona} capitation ⁴⁰. Yet even thisv
indulgence affords the most unquestionable proof of the public
miser-y. This tax was so extremely oppreffive, either in- itself
or in the mode of collecting it, that whilst the revenue was
increascd by extortion‚ it was diminished by despair: a confidet--
able part of the territory of Autun was left uncultivated3 and great
numbers of the provincials rather chose to live as exiles and
oudaws, than to support. the weight of civil society. It is<
but too probable, that the bountiful emperor relieved‚ by a par--
tial a& of liberality, one among the many evils which he had,
caused by his general maxims of administration. But even those:
maxims were less the effe& of choice than of neceflity. And if
we except the death of Maximian, the rei-gn of Constantine in GauL-

his life. The provinces were protested by his presence from the
inroads of the barbarians, who either dreaded or experiencedhis
active valour. After a fignal vietory over the Franks and Ale-
manni, several -of their princes were exposed by his order to the
wild beasts in the amphitheatre of Treves, and the people seem
to have enjoyed the spediale without discovering, in such a treatw
ment of royal captives, any thing that was repugnant to the laws of·
nations or of humanity ⁴¹.

The virtues of Constantine were rendered more illustrious by the
vices of Maxentius. Whilst the Gallie provinces enjoyed as much
