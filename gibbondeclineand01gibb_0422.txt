THE DECLINE AND FALL

Among the useful conditions of peace nnpofed by Probus on the
vanquished nations of Germany, was the obligation of supplying
the Roman army with sixteen thousand redi-aits, the bravest and
most robust of their youth. The emperor dispersed them through
all the provinces, and distributed this dangerous reinforcement in
small bands, of fifty or sixty each, among the national troops;

the barbarinos, ‘ssiould be felt but not seen ⁴⁵. Their aid was now
become neceffary. The fceble elegance of Italy and the interna}
provinces could no longer'support the weight of arms, The hardy
frontier of the Rhine and Danube still produced minds and bodies
equal to the labours of the camp; but a perpetual series of wars had
gradually diminilhed their numbers. The infrequency of marriage,
and the ruin of agriculture, affected the principles of population, and
not only destroyed the strength of the present, but intercepted the
hope of future, generations. The wisdor'n of Probus embraced a great

and beneficial plan of replenishing tlte exhausted frontiers, by new·
'colonies of captive or fugitive barbarians, on whom he bestowed
lands, cattle, instruments of hufflandry, and every encouragement
that might engage them to educate a *race of soldiersr for the service
of the republic. Into Britain, and most probably 'into Cambridge-

ssiire ⁴⁶, he transported a considerable body of Vandals. The ini-¹·
poffibility of an escape, reconciled them to their situation, and in

the subsequent troubles of that issand, they approved themselves the
most faithful servants of the state 4⁷. Great numbers of Franks
and Gepidae were settled on the banks of the Danube and the
Rhine. An hundred thousand Bastarnae, expelled from their own
