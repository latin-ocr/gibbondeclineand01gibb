OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

that memorable junEture, to have eluded the power of Severus, and
to have obtained a signal vietory on the banks of the Carun, in which
the son of the [sing os the World‚ Caracal, fied from his arms along
the fields of his pride ¹³. Something of a doubtful mist still hangs
over these Highland traditions; nor can it be entirely dispelled by
the most ingenious researches of modern criticism ¹⁴: but if we could,
with safety, indulge the pleafing supposltion that Fingal lived, and
that Offian sung, the strikIng contrast of the situation and manners
of the contending nations might amuse a philosophie mind. The
parallel would be little to the advantage of the more civilized people,
if we compared the unrelenting revenge of Severus with the gene-
rous clemency of Finga13 the timid and brutal cruelty of Caracalla,
with the bravery, the tenderness‚ the elegant genius of Offian3 the
mercenary chiefs who, from motives of fear or interest, served under
the Imperial standard, with the freeborn warriors who started to
arms at the voice of the king of Morven; if, in a word, we con-
templated the untutored Caledoniam, glowing with the warm vir-

tues of nature, and the degener-ate Romans, polluted with the mean
vices of wealth and ssavery.

The declining health and last illness of Severus inflamed the wild
ambition and black paffions of Caracalla's soul. Impatient of any
delay or division of empire‚ he attempted, more than once, to
shorten the small remainder of his father’s days, and endeavoured,

but without success, to excite a mutiny among the troops ¹⁵. The

¹⁴ That the Caracul ofOffian is the Cara-
calla of the Roman history, is, perhaps, the
only point of British antiquity, in which Mr.
Macpherson and Mr. Whitaker are of the
same opinion3 and yet the opinion is not
without difficulty. In the Caledonian war,
the son of Severus was known only by the
appellation of Antoninus; and it may seem

strange, that the Highland bard should de-

scribe him by a nick-name‘‚ invented four
years afterwards, scarcely used by the Ro-
mans till after the death of that emperor,
and seldom employed by the most ancient
historians. See Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1317· Hist.
