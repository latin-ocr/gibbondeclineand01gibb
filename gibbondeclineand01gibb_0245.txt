OFv THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

taxes with which Maximin had loaded the rights of inheritance and
suc'cefiion‚ were repealed, or *at least moderated. Discipline was
revived‚ and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were en-
act‘ed by their imperial ministers, who endeavoured to restore a civil
constitution 011 the ruins of military tyranny. “ What reward may
“ we expect for delivering Rome from a monster ?'' was the question
asked by MaximuS, in a moment of freedom and confidence. Bal-
binus answercd it without hesitation, ‘⁶ The love of the senate, of
“ the people, and of all mankind.” “ Alas !'’ replied his more

mon foe, Balbinus, who remained at Rome, had been engaged in
scenes of blood and intestine discord. Distrust and jealousy reigned
in the senate3 and even in the temples where they assembled‚ every
senator carried either open or concealed arms. In the midst of their
deliberations‚ two veterans of the guards, actuated either by curiosity

spies, for such they deemed them, dead at the foot of the altar, and

then advancing to the door of the senate, imprudently exhorted the
multitude to maffacre the Praetorians‚ as the secret adherents of the

tyrant. Those who escaped the first fury of the tumult took refuge
in the camp, which they defended with superior advantage against
the reiterated attacks of the people, affisted by the numerous bands
