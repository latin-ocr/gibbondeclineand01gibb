gradually extended from the Rhine to the Danube. About the reign C H Α Ρ-

of Hadrian, when that mode of defcnce began to be praetised, these h—-v—-J

garrisons were connected and covered by a strong intrenchment of trees
and palisades. In the place of so rude a bulwark‚ the emperor Probus
constructed a stone-wall of a considerable height, and strengthened
it by towers at convenient distances. From the neighbourhood of
Newstadt and Ratisbon on the Danube, it stretched across hills,
vallies, rivers, and morasses, as far as Wimpfen on the Necker,
and at length terminated on the banks of the Rhine, after a wind-
ing course of near two hundred miles ⁴³. This important barrier,
uniting the two mighty streams that protested the provinces of Eu-
rope, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the barbari-
ans, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with the greatest
facility into the heart of the empire. But the experience of the world
from China to Britain, has exposed the vain attempt of fortifying
any extensive tra& of country ⁴⁴. An active enemy, who can sele&
and vary his points of attack‚ must, in the end, discover some feeble
spot or some unguarded moment. The strength, as well as the at-
tention, of the defenders is divided; and such are the blind effects
of terror on the firmest troops, that a line broken in a single place,
is almost instantly deserted. The fate of the wall which Probus
eredked, may confirm the general observation. Within a few years
after his death, it was overthrown by the Alemanni. Its scattered
ruins, universally ascribed to the power of the Daemon, now serve
only to excite the wonder of the Swabian peasant.
