OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE,

Roman world, were all confidercd by the people, as equalry true;
by the philosopher, as equally false ; and by the magistrate, as
equally useful. And thus toleration produced not only mutual
indulgence, but even religious concord.

The superstition of the people was not embittered by any mixture
of theological rancour; nor was it confined by the chains of any
speculative system. The devout polytheist, though ‘fondly attached
to his national rites, admitted with implicit faith the different reli-
gions of the earth ³. Fear, gratitude, and curiosity, a dream or an
omen, a singular disorder or a distant journey‚ perpetually disposed
him to multiply the articles of his belief, and to enlarge the list of
his protectors. The thin texture of the Pagan mythology was inter-
woveri with various, but not discordant materials. As soon as it was
allowed that fages and heroes, who had lived, or who had died for
the benefit of their country, were exalted to a state of power and im—
mortality, it was universally confeffed, that they deser-ved, if not
the adoration, at least the reverence, of all mankind. The deities of
a thousand groves and a thousand streams poffeffed, in peace, their
local and respeefive influence; nor could the Roman who depre-
cated thewrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian who presented his
offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The vifible powers
of Nature, the planets, and the elements‚ were the same throughout
the universe. The invisible governors of the moral world were in-
evitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every
virtue, and even vice, acquired its divine representative3 every art
