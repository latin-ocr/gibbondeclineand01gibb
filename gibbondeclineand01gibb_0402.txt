rience had enabled him to excel, he again took the field a few
months after his triumph. It was expedient to exercise the restless
temper of the legions in some foreign war, and the Persian monarch,
exulting in the shame of Valerian‚ still braved with impunity the
offended majesty of Rome. At the head of an army, less formidable
by its numbers than by its discipline and valour, the emperor ad-
vanced as far as the Streights which divide Europe from Asia. He
there experienced, that the most absolute power is a weak defence
against the effecits of despair. He had threatened one of his secre-
taries who was accused of extortion3 and it was known that he sel-
dom threatened in vain. The last hope which remained for the
criminal‚ was to involve some of the principal officers of the army
in his danger, or at least in his fears. Artfully counterfeiting his
master’s hand, he ssiewed them, in a long and bloody list, their own
names devoted to death. Without suspefflng or examining the
fraud, they resolved to secure their lives by the murder of the em-
peror. On his march, between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian
was suddenly attaeked by the conspirators‚ whose stations gave them a
right to surround his person ; and, after a 1hort resistance, fell by the
hand of Mucapor‚ a general whom he had always loved and trusted.
