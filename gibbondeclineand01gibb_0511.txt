OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE· 491

that a cautious historiari will scarcely venture to adopt them. We C ξιξζ P.
are told that Galerius, who had formed a very imper-sc& notion of Μ
the greatuess of Rome by the cities of the East, with which he was ⁸
acquainted‚ found his forces inadequate to the siege of that

immense capital. But the *extent of a city serves only to render

it more acceflible to the enemy; Rome had long smce been accus-

tomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror3 nor could the
temporary enthusiasm of the people have long contended against

the discipline and valour of the legions. We are likewise in-

formed, that the legions themselves were struck with horror and

remorse, and that those pious sons of the republic refused to vio-

late the sanetity of their venerable parent ²⁶. But when we recollest

with how much ease in the more ancient civil παῖε, the zeal of

party, and the habits of military obedience, had converted the

native citizens of Rome into-her most implacable enemies, we

shall be inclined to distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and
barbarians, who had never beheld Italy till they entered it in a ho-

stile manner. Had they not been restrained by motives of a more

interested nature, they would probably have answered Galerius in

the words of Caesar’s veterans: “ If our general wishes to lead us

“ to the banks of the Tyber, we are prepared to traee out his camp.

“ Whatsoever walls he has determined to level with the ground,
“ our,hands are ready to work the engines: nor shall we hesitare,

“ ihould the name of the devoted city be Rome itself.’‘ These are
indeed the expreffions of a poet; but of a poet who has been dis-
tinguistied and even censured for his stri& adherence to the truth of

history ²⁷.
