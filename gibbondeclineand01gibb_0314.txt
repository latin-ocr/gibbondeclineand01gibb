and destructive ini-oads ¹⁹. In this interval therefore, of -about seventy
years, we must place the second migration of the Goths, from the

among the various motives which acinace the conduct of un-
settled barbarians. Eithera pestilence, ora famine, a viCtory‚ or a de-
feat, an oracle of the Gods‚ or the eloquence of a daring leader, were
sufficient to impel the Gothic arms on the milder climates of the
south. Resides the influence of a martial religion, the numbers
and spirit of the Goths were equal to the most dangerous adven-
turess The use of round bucklers and short swords rendered
them formidable in a close engagement3 the manly obedience
which they yieldcd to hereditary kings gave uncommon union
and stability to their councils ²⁰, and the renowned Amaia, the hero
of that age and the tenth ancestor of TheodoriC‚ king of Italy,

his birth, which he derived from the Affiu, or demigods of the
