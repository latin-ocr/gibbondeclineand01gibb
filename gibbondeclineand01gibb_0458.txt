433 [HEVDECLINE AND FALL

C {Hs} P. The conduct which the emperor Probus had-adopted in the dis-,

mgr? posal of the vanquished, was imitated by Diocletian and his affo·‘

ostin- barba- ciates. The captive barban-iaus, exchangiug death for ssavery, were'

rums. distributed among the provincials, and affigned to those districts
(in Gaul, the territories of Amicus, Beauvais, Cambray, Treves,·
Langres, and Troyes, are particularly *specified ³5) which had been:
depopulatcd by the calamities of war. They were usefully.'em-=
ployed as shepherds and husbandmen, but were denied the exercise of
arms, except when it was found expedient to enrol them in the
military service. Nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands,
with a less servile tenure, to such of the barbarians as solicited:
the protection of Rome. They granted a> settlement to several
colonies of the Carpi, the Bastarnae, and the Sarmatians; and, by a
dangerous indulgence, permitted them in some measure to retain
their national manners and independence³⁸. Among* the pro-.
vincials, it was a subject of fiattering exultation, that the barbarian,
so lately an object of terror, now cultivated their lands, drove their·
'cattle to the neighbouring fair, and contributed by his-labour to the
public plenty. They congratulated their masters on the powerful
accession of subjeets and soldiers; but they forgot to observe‚ that
multitudes of secret enemies, insolent from favour, or desperate
from oppreffion, were introduced into the heart„ of the empire ³⁹.
