the same homage to the Jupiter of the Capitol, would have been an
objetst of abhorrence to himself and to his brethren. But the mode·

judices of their subject& who were alarmed and scandalized at the
ensigns of paganismo, which necessarily introduced themselves into

own statue in the temple of Jerusalem, was defeated by the unani-

an idolatrous profanation ⁸. Their attachment to the law of Moses
was equal to their detestation of foreign religions. The current of
zeal and devotion, as it was contracted into a narrow chamuel, ran
with the strength, and sometimes with the fury, of a torrent.

This inflexible perseverance‚ which appeared so odious or so ridi-
culous to the ancient world, assumes a more awful character, fince
Providence has deigned to reveal to us the myster10us history of
the chosen people. But the devout and even scrupulous attach-
