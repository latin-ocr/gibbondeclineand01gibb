THE DECLINE AND FALL

rous party has been compclled to yield to the more violent and se—
ditious ⁴⁶.

A general of the tribe was elected on oceafions of danger3 and, if
the danger was preffing and extensive, several tribes concurred in
the choice of the same general. The bravest warrior was named
to lead his countrymen into the field, by his example rather than by
his commands. But this power, however limited, was still invi-
dious. It expired with the war, and in time of peace the German
tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief ⁴⁷. Princes were, how-
ever, appointed, in the general affembly, to administer justice,
or rather to compose differences ⁴³, in their respective districis.
ln the choice of these magistrates, as much regard was fhewn to
birth as to merit ⁴⁹. To each was affigned, by the public, a guard,
and a council of an hundred persons; and the first of the princes
appears to have enjoyed a pre-eminence of rank and honour which
sometimes tempted the Romans to compliment him with the regal
title⁵⁵.

The comparative view of the powers of the magistrate8‚ in two
remarkable instances‚ is alone sufficient to represent the whole
system of German manners. The disposal of the landed property
within their district, was absolutely vested in their hands, and they
distributed it every year according to a new division ⁵¹. At the same
time they were not authorized to punish with death, to imprison,
or even to strike, a private citizen ⁵². A people thus jealous of their
persons, and careless of their poffeffions, must have been totally des-
titute ofindustry and the asts, but animated with a high sense of
honour and independence.
