in the command of an army less distinguissied indeed for discipline

than for numbers and valour ¹⁹, Albinus braved the menaces of

the obedience of the former, whilst the voluptuous Syrians were less
delighted with the mild firmness of his administration‚ than with
the affability of his manners, and the apparent pleasure with which.
