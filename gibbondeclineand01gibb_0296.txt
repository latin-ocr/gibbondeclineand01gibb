Germans have more than once been driven back upon the enemy,
by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded death much
less than servitude. If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well
knew how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own
hands, from an insulting vi&or⁶¹. Heroines of such a cast may
claim our admirati0n; but they were most affuredly, neither lovely,
nor very susceptible of Iove. Whilst they affected to emulate the
stern virtues of man, they must have resigned that attractive softness
in which principally confist the charm and weakness of woman.
Conscious pride taught the German females to suppress every tendet
emotion that stood in competition with honour, and the first honour
of the sex has ever been that of chastity. The sentiments and
conduct of these high-spirited rnatrons may, at once, be confidered
as a cause, as an effect, and as a proof of the general character of
the nation. Female courage, however it may be raised by fanaticism,
or confirmed by habit, can be only a faint and imperfe& imitation
of the manly valour that distinguishes the age or country in which
it may be found.
