with the destruetion of those obsolete accounts, which by the empe-
ror-’s order were burnt in the forum of Trajan ⁹⁰. In an age when
the principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the
most defirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious
means ; but a temporary gricvance of such a nature can scarcely ex·
cite and support a serious civil war. The repetition of intolerable
taxes, imposed either on the land or on the neceffaries of life, may
at last provoke those vvho will not, or who cannot, relinquish their
country. But the case is far otherwise in every operation which, by
whatsoever expediemus, restores the just value of money. The tran-
fient evil is soon obliterated by the permanent benefit, the loss is
divided among multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experi-
ence a senfible diminution of treasure, with their riches they at the
same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they de-
rived from the poffeffion of them. However Aurelian might chuse
to disguise the real cause of the insurreetion, his reformation of the
coin could furnish only a faint pretence to a party alreadypovverful
and discontented, Rome, though deprived of freedom, was dis-
tracted by faction. The people, towards whom the emperor, him-
self a plebeian, always expreffed a peculial· fondness, lived in per-
petual difl'enfion with the senate, the equestrian order, and the Prae-
torian guards ⁹¹. Nothing less than the firm though secret conspiracy
of those orders, of the authority of the first, the wealth of the second,
and the arms of the third, could have displayed a strength capable of
contending in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube, which,

under the conduct of a martial sovereign, had atchieved the conquest
of the Vv'est and of the East.
