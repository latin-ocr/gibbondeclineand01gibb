“ cian,’' said Severus, with astonishment, “ art thou disposed to ι-γ--ι
“ wrestle after thy race ?” Most willingly‚ Sir, replied the un-

wearied youth, and, almost in a breath‚ overthrew seven of the ⁷
strongest soldiers in the army. A gold collar was the prize of

‘his matchless vigour and afflvsty, and he was immediately ap-

pointed to serve in the horse-guards who always attended on the

person of the sovereign ².

Maximin‚ for that was his name, though born on the territories Hisnmilimvry
of the empire, deseended from a mixed race of barbarians. His 'fleggzcuessna
father w'as a Goth, and his mother, of the nation of the Alani.
He displayed, on every occafi0n‚ a valour equal to his strength;
and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the
knowledge of the world. Under the reign of Severus and his son,
he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favour and esteem
of both those princes, the former of whom was an excellent judge
of merit. Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the affaffin of
Caracalla. Honour taught him to decline the effeminate insults of
Elagabalus. On the accession of Alexander he returned to court,
and was placed by that prince, in a station useful to the service,
and honourable to himself. The fourth legion, to which he was
appointed tribune, soon became, under his care, the best disciplined
of the whole army. With the general applause of the soldiers,
who bestowed on their favourite hero the names of Ajax and
Hercules, he was succeffively promoted to the first military com-
mand ³‚ and had not he still retained too much of his savage origin,

the emperor might perhaps have given his own slster in marriage to
i the son of Maximin 4.
