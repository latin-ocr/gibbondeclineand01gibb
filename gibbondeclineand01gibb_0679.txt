of his blood, and received his orders to bestow five-and-twenty pieees
of gold on the executioner. The martyr then covered his face with
his hands, and at one blow his head was separated from his body·
His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of
the Gentiles: but in the night it was removed, and transported in
a triumphal proceffion and with a splendid illumination to the burial-
place of the Christians. The funeral of Cyprian was publickly cele-
brated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magis-
ffate33 and those among the faithful who had performed the last
offices to his person and his memory, were secure from the danger of
inquiry or of punishment. It is remarkable, that of so great a
multitude of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the first
who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom ³⁸.

It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to live
an apostate: but on that choice depended the alternative of honour
or infamy. Could we suppose that the bishop of Carthage had em-
ployed the profeflion of the Christian faith only as the instrument os
his avarice or ambition‚ it was still incumbent on him to support the
charafiter which he had affumed 39; and, if he possessed the smallest
degree of manly fortitude, rather to expose himself to the most
cruel tortures, than by a single a& to exchange the reputation
of a whole life, for the abhorrence of his Christian brethren and
the contempt of the Gentile world. But if the zeal of Cypriam was
supported by the sincere convidtion of the truth of those doCtrines
which he preached‚ the crown of martyrdorn must have appeared
to him as an objch of desire rather than of terror. It is not easy to
