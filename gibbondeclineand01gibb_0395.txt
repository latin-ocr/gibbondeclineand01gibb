OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 375

r Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with the hope of freedom, C HXIA P.
and, at the head of their furious multitude, broke into the city of ’.ω-«Η
Alexandria, where he affumed the Imperial purple, coined money,
publissied edidis, and raised an army, which, as he vairily boasted,

he was capable of maintaining from the sole profits of his paper

trade. Such troops were a feeble defence against the approach of
Aurelian3 and it seems almost unneceffary to relate, that Firmus

was routed, taken, tortured‚ and put to death. Aurelian might now
congratulate the senate, the people, and himself, that in little more

than three years, he had restored universal peace and order to the

Roman world ⁷⁶.

Since the foundation of Rome, no general had more nobly deserved ζΙὲ-,Β- 2174 f
a triumph than Aurelian; nor was a triumph ever celebrated with ciii-Ueiizi'n’.0
superior pride and magnificence ⁷⁷. The pomp was opened by twenty
elepliants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred of the most curi-
ous animals from every climate of the North, the East, and the South.
They were followed by sixteen hundred gladiators, devoted to the
cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The wealth of Asia, the arms
and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the magnificent plate
and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were disposed in exa& symmetry
or artful disorder. The ambassadors of the most remote parts of
the earth, of AEthiopia‚ Arabia, Persia, Bactriana, India, and China‚
all remarkable by their rich or singular dreffes, displayed the fame
and power of the Roman emperor, who exposed likewise to the
public view the presente that he had received, and particularly a
great number of crowns of gold, the offerings of grateful citieS.
The vidiories of Aurelian were attested by tlie long train of cap-

we mayjustly infer, that Firmus was the last they huppen to be interesting. Hist. Aug. 220.
