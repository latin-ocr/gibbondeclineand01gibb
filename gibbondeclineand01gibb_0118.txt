II. The division of Europe into a number of independent states,
conneCstd, however, with each other, by the general resemblance
of religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most bene-
ficial consequences to the liberty of mankind. A modern tyrant,
who should find no resistance either in his own breast, or in his
people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from the example
of his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of his allies,
and the apprehension of his enemies. The object of his displeasure,
escaping from the narrow limite of his dominions, would easily
obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune ade-
quare to his merit, the freedom of complaint, and perhaps the means
of revenge. But the empire of the Romans filled the world, and
when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world
became a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. The ssave of
Imperial despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his gilded
chain in Rome and the senate, or to wear out a life of exile on the
