THE DlZCLlNE AND FALL

that the pyratical vessels used by the barbarians of Pontus and the
Leffer Scythia, were not capable of containing more than tvvznty·
five or thirty men, we may safely affirm, that fifteen thousand war-
riom, at the most, embarked in this great expedition. Impatient of
the limits of the Euxine, they steered their destructive course from
the Cimmerian to the Thracian Bosphorus. W'hen they had almost
gained the middle of the Straits, they were suddenly driven back

of captives and deserters must have been very neceffary to pilot their
