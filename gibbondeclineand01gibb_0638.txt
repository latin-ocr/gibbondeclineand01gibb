of pious forgeries, which, under the names of Orpheus, Hermes,
and the Sibyls ¹⁹³, were obtruded on him as of equal value with
the genuine inspiratione of Heaven. The adoption of fraud and
sophistry in the defenee of revelation, too often reminds us of the
injudicious condu& of those poets who load their invulnerable heroes
with a useless weight of cumbcrsometmd brittle armour.

But how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and
philosophie world, to those evidences which were presented by the
hand of Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their senses?
During th'e age of Christ, of his apostles, and of their first disciples,
the do&rine which they preached was confirmed by innumerable
prodigies. The lame walked, the blind saw, the sick were heased,
the dead were raised, daemons were expelled, and the laws of Nature
were frequently suspended for the benefit of the church. But the
fages of Greece and Rome turned aslde from the awful speetaele‚ and

quoted by the fathers from Justin Mai-tyr to
Lafiantius. KVhen the Sibylline verses had
performed their appointed task, they, like
the system of the millennium, were quietly laid
afide. The Christian Sibyl had unluckily
fixed the ruin of Rome for the year 195,
