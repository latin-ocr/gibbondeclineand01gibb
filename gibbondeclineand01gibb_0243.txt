OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ssmuld on a sudden relinquilh the fruitless siege, and march direffly
towards Rome. The fate of the empire and the cause of freedom
must then be committed to the chance of a battle3 and what arms
could he opposc to the veteran legions of the Rhine and Danube?
Some troops newly levied among the generous but encrvatcd youth
of Italy3 and a body of German auxiliaries, on whose firmuess, in
the hour of trial, it was dangerous to depend. In the midst of these
just alarms‚ the stroke of domestic conspiracy punished the crimes

army3 and his wanton and ill-timed cruelty, instead of striking
terror, inspired hatred and a just desire of revenge. A party of
Praetorian guards, who trembled for their wives and children in the
camp of Alba, near Rome, executed the sentence of the senate. Max-
