OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

' It is a very ancient reproach, suggested by the ignor-auce or the
malice of infidelity, that the Christiane. allured into their party the
most atrocious criminals, who, as soon as they were touched by a
sense of remorse, were-easily persuaded to wash away, in the water
of baptism, the guilt of their past conduct, for which the temples
