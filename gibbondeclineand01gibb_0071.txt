OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Among the innumerable monuments of architecture construned

by the Romans, how many have escaped the notice of history, how
few have refisted the ravages of time and barbarism Ξ And yet even

the majestic ruins that are still seattered over Italy and the pro-
vinces, would be sufficient to prove, that those countries were once
the seat ofa polite and powerful empire. Their greatness alone, or
their beauty‚ might deserve our attention; but they are rendered
mor-e interesting, by two important circumstances, which connect the
agreeable history of the arts, with the more useful history of human
manners. Many of those works were eredied at private expence,
and almost all were intended for public benefit.

It is natural to suppose that the greatest number, as well as the
most considerable of the Roman edifices, were raised by the empe-
rors, who poffqffed so unbounded a command both of men and
money. Augustus was accustomed to boast that he had found

his capital of brick, and that he had left it of marble ⁶⁴. The
stri& oeconomy of Vespafian was the source of his magnifi-
cence. The works of Trajan bear the stamp of his genius. The
public monuments with which Hadrian adorned every province of
the empire, were executed‚ not only by his orders, but under his
immediate inspection. He was himself an artist3 and he loved the
arts, as they conduced to the glory of the monarch. They were
encouraged by the Antonines‚ as they contributedto the happiness
of the people. But if the emperors were the first, they were not the
only architecte of their dominions. Their example was universally
imitated by their principal subjecte, who were not afraid of declar-
ing to the world that they had spirit to conceive, and wealth to ac-
