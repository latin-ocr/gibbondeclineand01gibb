OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
The fate of the Gordians filled Rome with just, but unexpected

terror. The senate convoked in the temple of Concord, affected to ⁸

transa& the common busmess of the day3 and seemed to decline,
with trembling anxiety, the consideration of their own, and the
public danger. A silent consternation prevailed on the affembly,
till a senator, of the name and family of Trajan, awakened his
brethren from their fatal lethargy. He represented to them, that
the choice of cautious dilatory measures had been long smce out of
their power3 that Maximin, implacable by nature, and exasperated
by injuries, was advancing towards Italy, at the head of the military
force of the empire3 and that their only remaining alternative,
was either to meet him bravely in the field, or tamely to expe&
the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful re-
bellion. “ We have lost, continued he, two excellent princes3 but
‘⁶ unless we desert ourselves‚ the hopes of the republic have not
“ peristied with the Gordians. Many are the senators, whose virtues
“ have deserved, and whose abilities would sustam, the Imperial
“ dignity. Let us ele& two emperors, one of whom may con-
“ du& the war against the public enemy, whilst his colleague
‘⁸ remains at Rome to dire& the civil administration. γ Ι cheerfully
“ expose myself to the danger and envy of the nominatim, and
“ give my vote in favour of Maximus and Balbinus. Ratify my
‘f choice‚ conscript fathers, or appoint in their place, others more
“ worthy of the empire.'’ The general apprehenfion filenced the
whispers of jealousy3 the merit of the candidates was universally
acknowledged; and the house resounded with the fincere ae-
clamafions, of “ long life and viGtory to the emperors Max-
“ imus and Balbinus. You are happy in the judgment of the

month and fix days, for the reign of Gor· p. 193. Zosimus relates‚ 1. i. p. ¹7· that
