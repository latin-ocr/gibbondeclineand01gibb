THE DECLINE AND FALL

of a very different nature from those of his admired predecessor. By
investing a luxurious youth with the honours of the purple, Marcus
had discharged a debt of private gratitude, at the expence, indeed, ofthe
happiness of the state. By associating a friend and a fellow-soldier to
the labours of government,Diocletian, in a time of public danger, pro-
vided for the defence both of the East and of the West. Maximian
was born a peasant, and, like Aurelian, in the territory of Sirmium.
Ignorant of letters ⁷, careless of laws, the rusticity of his appear-
ance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated fortune the
meanness of his extradiion. XVar was the only art which he pro-

received the honours of Caesar and Augustus
has divided modern critics, and given occa-

weighcd the several reasons and difficulties
with his scrupulous accuracy.

infer, that Maximian was more desirous of
being considered as a soldier than as a man of
letters: and it is in this manner that we can
often transsate the language of flattery into
that of truth-
