-of whom the Christiane might constitute at the most a twentieth
part ¹⁷⁰.

The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge
of Christianity from the same source which had diffused among
thern the language, the sentiments, and the manners of Rome. In
this more important circumstance, Africa, as well as Gaul, was
gradually fassiioned to the imitation of the capital. Yet notwith-
standing the many favourable occasions which might invite the
Roman miffionaries to visit their Latin provinces, it was late before
they paffed either the sea or the Alps¹⁷' ; nor can we discover in
those great countries any affured traces either of saith or of perse-
