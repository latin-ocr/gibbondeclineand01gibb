OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

testimony of Origen ¹⁸³, the proportion of the faithful was very in-
v confiderable when compared with the multitude os an unbelieving
world; but, as we are left without any distinct information, it is im-
poflible to determine, and it is difficult even to conjcc'mre, the real
numbers of the primitive Christians. The most favourable calcula-
’ tlon, however, that can be deduced from the examples ofAntioch and
of Rome, will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth
part of the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under
the bannet· of the cross before the important conversion of Con·
stamine. But their habits of saith, of zeal, and of union, seemed
to multiply their numbers 3 and the same causes which contributed
to their future increase, served to render their actual strength more
apparent and more formidable.
Such is the constitution of civil society, that whilst a few persons
are distinguished by riches, by honours, and by knowledge, the

body of the people is condemned to obscurity, ignorance, and nora

poverty. The Christian religion, which addrefl'ed itself to the whole
human race, must consequently colle& a far greater number of pro-
selytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of life. This
innocent and natural circumstance has been improved into a very
odious imputation, which seems to be less strenuoussy denied by the
apologists, than it is urged by the adversaries, of the faith; that the
new se& of Christians was almost entirely composed of the dregs of
the populace, of peasants and mechanics, of boys and women, of
beggars and ssaves, the last of whom might sometimes introduce the
miffionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged.
These obscure teachers (such was the charge of malice and infidelity)
are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in
private. Whilst they cautioussy avoid the dangerous encounter of
philosophers, they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd, and
