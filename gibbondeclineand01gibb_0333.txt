OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Another invasion of the Alemanni, of a more formidable ascht,
but more glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower em-
pire. Three hundred thousand of that warlike people are said to
have been vanquished‚ in a battle near Milan, by Gallienus in pcr-
. son, at the head of only ten thousand Romans ⁹¹. 'ch may how-
ever, with great probability, ascribe this incredible viCtory, either to
the credulity of the historian, or to some exaggerated exploits of one
of the emperor's lieutenants. It was by arms of a very different

nature, that Gallienus endeavoured to prote& Italy from the fury of

the Germans. He espoused Pipa the daughter of a king of the
Marcomanni, a Suevie tribe, which was often confounded with the
Alemanni in their wars and conquests ⁹². To the father, as the
price of his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia.
The native charms of unpolissied beauty seem to have fixed the
daughter in the affeetions of the inconstant emperor, and the bands
of policy were more firmly conneeted by those of love. But the
haughty prejudice of Rome still refused the name of marriage, to
the profane mixture of a citizen and a barbarian3 and has stigma-

tized the German princess with the opprobrious title of concubine of

Gallienus ⁹³.

scandinavia, or at least from Prussia, to the mouth of the Bory-
sthenes, and have followed their victorious arms from the Bory-
sthenes, to the Danube. Under the reigns of Valeriam and Gallienus
the frontier of the last mentioned river was perpetually infested by
the inroads of Germans and Sarmatians3 but it was defended by
the Romans with more than usual firmness and success. The pro--v
vinces that were the seat of war, recruited the armies of Rome with
