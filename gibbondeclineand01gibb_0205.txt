OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

restraints were imposed on the insolent luxury of the Roman peo-
ple, the price of provisions, and the interest of money, were re-
duced, by the paternal care of Alexander, whose prudent liberality,
without distressing the industrium, supplied the wants and> amuse-
ments of the populace. The dignity‚ the freedom, the authority
of the senate was restored3 and every virtuous senator might ap-
proach the person of the emperor, without a fear, and without a
blulh. -

The name of Antoninus, ennobled by the virtues of Pius and
Marcus, had been communicated by adoption to the dissolute Ve—
rus, and by descent to the cruel Commodus. It became the ho-
nourable appellation of the sons of Severus, was bestowed on young
Diadumenianu8‚ and at length prostituted to the infamy of the
high priest of Emesa. Alexander, though preffed by the studied,
and perhaps, sineere importunity of the senate, nobly refused the
borrovved lustre of a name; whilst in his whole conduct he laboured
to restore ‘the glories and felicity of the age of the genuine An-
tonines ⁷². ’

In the civil, administration of Alexander, vvisdom was enforced
by power, and the people, sensible of the public felicity, repaid
their benefa&or with their love and gratitude. There still remained a
greater, a more necessary, but a more difficult enterprise3 the refor-
mation of the military order, whose interest and temper, confirmed by
longimpunity, rendered them impatient of tlte restraints of dis-
cipline, and careless of the blessings of public tranquillity. ln the
execution of his delign the emperor affeeted to display his love,

and to conceal his fear, of the army. The most rigid oeconomy

⁷² See in the Hist. August. p. 116, 117, had cnjoyed, almost ativelvemonth, the 'oles-
the whole contest between Alexander and the sings of liis reign. Before the appellation of
senate, extr-acted from the journnls of that Antoninus was offered him as a title of ho-

ass'emblv. It happened on the sixth of March, nour, tlic senate waited to see whether Alex-
