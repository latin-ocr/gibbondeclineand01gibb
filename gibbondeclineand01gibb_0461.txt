OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

At the same time that Diocletian chastised the past crimes of the
Egyptians, he provided for their future safety and happiness by
many wife regulations which were confirmed and enforced under the
succeeding reigns ⁴⁹. One very remarkable edict, which he pub-
lilhed, instead of being condemned as the effe& of jealous tyranny‚
deserves to be applauded as an a& of prudence and humanity. He
caused a diligent inquiry to be made “ for all the ancient books
“ which treated of the admirable art of making gold and filver,
“ and without pity committed thern to the flamcss apprehensive,
“ as we are affured, lest the opulence of the Egyptians should in-

if Diocletian had been convinced of the reality of that valuable
art, far from extinguishing the memory, he would have eonverted
the operation, of it to the benefit of the public revenuess lt is much
*more likely that his good sense discovered to him the folly of such
magnificent pretenfions, and that he was defirous of preserving the
reason and foi-tunes of his subje&s from the mischievous pursuit.
It may be remarked, that these ancient books, so liberally ascribed
to Pythagoras, to Solomon, or to Hermes, were the pious frauds
of more recent adepts. The Greeks were inattentive either to the
use or to the =abuse of chymistry. In that immense register, where
Pliny has depofited the discoveries, the arts, and the errors of man-
kind, there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals;
and the perseeution of Diocletian is the first authentie event in the
history of alchymy. The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs diffused
that vain seience over the globe. Congenial to the avarice of the
human heart‚ it was fludied in China as in Europe, with equal
‹eagerness, and with equal success. The darkness of the middle
