92 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΙῖΠΑ Ρ· We may readily believe, that the father of his country hesitated

μ-Ὓῇι whether he ought to intrust the various and doubtful character of his
g'fss'adr'iith. kinsman Hadrian with sovereign power. In his last moments, the
arts of the empress Plotina either fixed the irresolution of Trajan, or
boldly supposed a fictitious adoption ³³3 the truth of which could not
be safely disputed‚ and Hadrian was peaceably acknowledged as his
lawful successor. Under his reign, as has been already mentioned,
the empire flourissned in peace and prosperity. He encouragcd the
arts, reformed the laws, asserted military discipline, and visited all
his provinces in person. His vast and active genius was equally
suited to the most enlarged views, and the minute details of civil
policy. But the ruling paffions of his soul were curiofity and
vanity. As they prevailed, and as they were attraeced by different
objeEls, Hadrian was, by turns, an excellent prince, a ridiculous
sophist, and a jealous tyrant. The general tenor of his condu&
deserved praise for its equity and moderation. Yet in the first days
of his reign, he put to death four consular senators, his personal
enemies, and men who had been judged worthy of empire; and the
tediousness of a painful illness rendered him, at last, peevish and
cruel. The senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a
god or a tyrant; and the honours decreed to his memory were
granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus ³⁹.
