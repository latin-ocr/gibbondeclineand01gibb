OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

History‚ which undertakes to record the mansuetioris of the past,
for the instruction of future, ages; would ill deserve that honour-
able office, if ssie condescended to plead the cause of tyrants, or to
justify the maxims of persecution. It must however be acknow-

or a Louis XIV. might have acquired a just knowledge of the rights
of conscience, of the obligation of saith, and of the innocence of

strangers to those principles which inspired and authorized the in-
flexible obstinacy of the Christians in the cause of truth, nor could
they themselves discover in their own breasts, any motive which
would have prompted them to refuse a legal, and as it were a natu-

‘enadted against the humble and obscure followers of Christ. From
the general view of their character and motives we might naturally
conclude: Ι. That a considerable time elapsed before they considered
