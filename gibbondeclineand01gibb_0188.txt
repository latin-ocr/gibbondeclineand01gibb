170 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C fh& P. the authority of a distant and feeble senate was little regarded) hung

v--a-«ss--a in anxious suspcnce ; as no candidate presented himself whose distin-

* guished birth and merit could cngnge their attachment ‘and unite

their suffrageS. The decisive weight of the Praetorian guards ele-

vated the hopes of their praefecis, and these powerful ministers be-

gan to affert their legal claim to fill the vacancy of the Imperial

throne. Adventus, however, the senior praefec‘t, conscious of his

age and infirmities, of his small reputation, and his smaller abili-

ties, resigned the dangerous honour to the crafty ambition of his

colleague Macrinus, whose well-diffembled grief removed all sus-

picion of his being acceffary to his master's death 4¹.. The troops

neither loved nor esteemed his charaeter. They cast their ⁴eye‘s

pected deliverance from a hated tyram, and it seemed of little conse-
quence to examine‘into the virtues -of the successor of Caracalla. But
as soon as the first transports of joy and surprise had subfided, they
began to scrutinize the mei-its of Macrinus with a critical severity,
and to arraign the hasty choice of the army. It had hitherto been
considered as a fundamental maxim of the constitut’mn, that the
emperor must bc always chosen in the senate, and the sovereign.
power, no longer exercised by the whole body, was always delegated
