530 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 1}ss P. broad and rapid stream of the Hebrus, and discovered the numerous
u—-v-ss-J army of Licinius, which filled the steep afcent of the hill, from the
river to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were spent in doubt-
ful anddistant ikirmissies ; but at length the obstacles of the'paffage
and of the attack were removed by the intrepid condu& of Con-
stamine. In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of
Constantine, which, though it can scarcely be paralleled either in
poetry or romance, is celebrated, not by a venal orator devoted to
his fortune, but by an historiam, the partial enemy of his fame.
We are affured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the
river Hebrus, accompanied only by twelve horsemen, and that by

combat on equal ground in ‘the plain. The contest was no longer
equal. His confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquissied
by the experienced veterans of the West. Thirty-four thousand
men are reported to have been ssain. The fortified camp of Lici-
nius was taken by affault the evening of the battle; the greater part
