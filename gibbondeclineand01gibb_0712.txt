edict, to the whole body of Christians, who were exposed to a vio-
lent and general persecution ¹⁶⁷. Instead of those salutary restraints,
which had required the dire& and solemn testimony of an accuser,
it became the duty as well as interest of the Imperial officers, to
discover, to pursue, and to torment‚ the most obnoxious among the
faithful. Heavy penalties were denounced against all who should
presume to save a proscribed sectary from the just indignation of

the gods, and of the emperors. Yet, notwithstanding the severity of
this law, the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans‚ in concealing
their friends or relations, affords an honourable proof, that the

rage of superstition had not extinguistied in their minds the senti-
ments of nature and humanity ¹⁶⁴.

Diocletian had no sooner published his edid‘ts against the Christ-
ians, than, as if he had been defirous of committing to other
hands the work of persecution‚ he divested himself of the Imperial
purple. The charadier and fituation of his colleagues and succeffors
sometimes urged them to enforce‚ and sometimes inclined them
to suspend, the execution of these rigorous laws; nor can we ac-
quire a just and distinet idea of this important period of eccle-
fiastical history, unless we separately consider the state of Christ-
ianity, in the different parts» of the empire, during the space of
ten years, which elapsed between the first edidis of Diocletian, and
the final peace of the church.

The mild and humane temper of Constantius was averse to the
oppreffion of any part of his subjecis. The principal offices of his
palace were exercised by Christians. He loved their persons, esteemed
their fidelity‚ and entertained not any dissike to their religious prin-
ciples. But as long as Constantius remained in the subordinate
