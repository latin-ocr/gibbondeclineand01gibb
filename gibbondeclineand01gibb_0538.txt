vinces of the East, which, during thirty years, had respe&ed their
august dignity. Diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alle-
viate the missortunes of his daughter3 and, as the last return that he
expe&ed for the Imperial purple, which he had conferred upon
Maximin, he entreated that Valeria might be permitted to share his
retirement of Salona, and to close the eyes of her afflieted father ²³³.
He entreated, but as he could no longer threaten, his prayers were
received with coldness and disdain3 and the pride of Maximin was
gratified, in treating Diocletian as a suppliant, and his daughter as a
criminal. The death of Maximin seemed to afl'ure the empreffes of a
favourable alteration in their fortune. The public disorders relaxed
the vigilance of their guard, and they easily found means to escape
from the place of their exile, and to repair, though with some
precautiom and in disguise, to the court of Licinius. His be-
haviour, in the first days of his reign, and the honourable re-
ception which he gave to young candidianus, inspired Valeria
with a secret satisfaction, both on her own account, and on that of
her adopted son. But these grateful prospe&s were soon succeeded
by horrour and astonissnnent, and the bloody executions which
stained the palace of Nicomedia, sufficiently convinced her, that the
throne of Maximin was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than
himself. Valeria consulted her safety by a hasty fiight, and, still
accompanied by her mother Prisca, they wandered above fifteen
months ³4 through the provinces, concealed in the disguise of
