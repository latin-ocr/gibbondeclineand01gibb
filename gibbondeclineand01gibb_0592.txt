THE DECLINE AND FALL

0131( xl} P. struCted by prophecy, and surprifingly delivered from dan-

s--w—...J ger, fiekness, and from death itself, by the supplications of the

church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so fre-
quently conceived themselves to be the objects, the instruments,
or the spectator& very happily disposed thern to adopt with the same
ease, but with far greater justice, the authentic wonders of the
evangelie history3 and thus miracles that exceeded not the measure
of their own experience, inspired them with the most lively affurance
of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass the limits of their
understanding. It is this deep impression of supernatural truths,
which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith; a
state of mind described as the surest pledge of the divine favour
and of future felicity‚ and recommended as the first or perhaps the
only merit of a Christian. According to the more rigid doetors,
the moral virtues, which may be equally praetised by infidels, are
destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of ourjustification.

IV. But the primitive Christian demonstrated his saith by his
virtues; and it was very justly supposed that the divine persuafion
which enlightened or subducd the understanding, must, at the same

· time, purify the beart and dire& the actions of the believer. The

first apologists of Christianity who justify the innocence of their
brethren, and the writers of a later period who celebrate the sanitity
of their ancestors, display, in the most lively colours, the reforma-
tion of manners which was introduced into the world by the
preaching of the gospel. As it is my intention to remark only
such human causes as were permitted to second the influence of
revelation, Ι ssiall ssightly mention two motives which might
naturally render the lives of the primitive Christians much puret
and more austere than those of their Pagan contemporaries or their
degenerate succeslbrs3 repentance for their past sms, and the laud-
able desire of supporting the reputation of the society in which they
were engaged.
