OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 183

gallant spirit of chivalry, and the law of succeffion, have accustomed C 11st P.
us to allowa singular excepti0n; and a woman is often acknow- maij—„³
ledged the absolute sovereign of a great kingdom, in which she
would be deemed incapable of exercifing the smallest employment,
civil or military. But as the Roman emperors were still considered
as the generals and magistrates of the republic‚ their wives and
mothers‚ although distinguished by the name of Augusta, were never
associated to their personal honours; and a female reign would have
appeared an inexpiable prodigy in the eyes of those primitive Ro-
mans, who married without love, or loved without delicacy and re-
speet⁶⁴. The haughty Agrippina aspired, indeed, to share the ho-
nours? of the empire, which {he had conferred on her son; but her
mad ambition, detested by every citizen who felt for the dignity of
Rome, was disappointed by the artful firmness of Seneca and Bur-
rhus ⁶⁵. The good sense, or the indifference, of suceeeding princeS,
restrained them from offending the prejudices of their subjee'ts; and·
it was reserved for the profligate Elagabalus, to disgraee the aits of
the senate, with the name of his mother Soaemias, who was placed
by the fide of the consuls, and subscribed‚ as a regular member⁷
the decrees of the legissative assembly. Her more prudent sister,
Mamaea, declined the useless and odious prerogative‚ and a solemn
law was enaiieffl exeluding women for ever from the senate, and
devoting to the infernal gods, the head of the wretch by whom this
saneiion should be violated⁶⁶. The substance, not the pageantry,
of power was the objeet of Mamaea’s manly ambition. She main-
tained an absolute and lasting empire over the mind of her son, and

in his affefiion the mother could not brook a rival. Alexander,
