THE DECLINE AND FALL

thian cause3 but the superior power of Rome exasted from them a
reluCtant homage, which is still attested by their medals. After the
conclusion of the Parthian war under Marcus, it was judged pru-
dent to secure some substantial pledges of their doubtful fidelity.
Forts were construeted in several parts of the country, and a Roman
garrison was fixed in the strong town of Nifibis. During the trou-
bles that followed the death of Commodus, the princes of Osrhoene
attempted to shake off the yoke: but the stern policy of Severus
confirmed their dependence ⁴5, and the perfidy of Caracalla com—
pleted the easy conquest. Abgarus, the last king of Edessa, was sent
in chains to Rome, his dominions reduced into a province, and his
capital dignified with the rank of colony; and thus the Romans,
about ten years before the fall of the Parthian monarchy‚ obtained
a firm and permanent establilhment beyond the Euphrates ⁴⁶.
Prudence as well as glory might havejustified a war on the fide of
Artaxerxes, had his views been confined to the defence or the acqui·-
fition ofa useful frontier. But the ambitious Perfian openly avowed a

far more extensive defign of conquest3 and he thought himself able
to support his lofty pretenfions by the arms of reason as well as by

those of power. Cyrus, he alleged, had first subdued, and his suc-
ceffors had for a long time poffeffed, the whole extent of Asia, as
far as the Propontis and the AEgaean Sea3 the provinces of Caria
and Ionia, under their empire‚ had been governed by Perfian satraps,
and all Egypt, to the confines of AEthiopia‚ had acknowledged their ff
sovereignty 4⁷. Their rights had been suspended, but not destroyed,
by along usurpation3 and as soon as he received the Persian dia-
