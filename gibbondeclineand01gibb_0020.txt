The principal conquests of the Romans were atchieved under the
republic3 and the emperors, for the most part, were satisfied with
preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the poli'cy
of the senate, the active emulation of the consuls, and the martial
enthusiasm of the people. The seven first centuries were filled with
a rapid succession of triumph's3 but it was reserved for Augustus,
to reIInquish the ambitious defign of subduing the whole earth, and
to introduce a spirit of moderation into the public councils. In-
clined to peace by his temper and situation, it was easy for him to
discover, that Rome, in her present exalted situation, had much
less to hope than to fear from the chance of arms ; and that, in the
prosecution of remote wars, the undertaking became* every day
more difficult, the event more doubtful, and the poffeffion more
precarious‚ and less beneficial. The experience of Augustus added
weiglit to these salutary reflections, and effeffiually convinced him,
that, by the prudent vigour of his counsels, it would be easy to se·-
cure every conceffion‚ which the safety or the dignity of Rome
might require from the most formidable barbarians. Instead of ex-
posmg his person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians, he
obtained, by an honourable treaty, the restitution of the standards
and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of Craffus ¹.

duction of AEthiopia and Arabia Felix. They marched near a
thousand miles to the south of the tropic; but the heat of the climate
soon repelled the invaders, and protected the unwarlike natives of
