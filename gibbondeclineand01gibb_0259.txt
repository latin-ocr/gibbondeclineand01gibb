and profound sseep. As soon as he waked, he related to the king and to
the believing multitude, hisjourney to Heaven, and his intimate con-
ferences with the Deity. Every doubt was filenced by this supernatural
evidence; and the articles of the saith of zoroaster were fixed with
cqual authority and precisron ⁹. A short delineation of that celebrated
system will be found useful‚ not only to display the character of the
Persian nation, but to illustrate many of their most important trans-

attempt of Eastern philosophy to reconcile the existence of moral
and physical evil, with the attributes of a beneficent Creator and
governor of the world. The first and original Being, in whom, or
