easily multiply his disciples or accomplices. The Cliristians of
Rome, at the t'1me of the accidental, persecution of Nero, are repre-
sented by Tacitus as already amounting to a very great multitude ¹⁶⁷,
and the languageof that great historian is almost fimilar to *the style
employed by Livy, when he relates the introduetion and the sup-
preffion of the rites of Bacchus. After the Bacchanals had awaken-
ed the severity of the senate, it was likewise apprehended that a
very great multitude, as it were another people, had been initiated
into those abhorred mysteries. A more careful inquiry soon demon-
strated, that the offenders did not exceed seven thousand3 a num-
ber indeed sufficiently alarming‚ when considered as the object of

public justice'⁶⁸. It is with the same candid allowance that we
should interpret the vague expreffions of Tacitus, and in a former
instance of Pliny,· when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded
fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods. The
church of Rome was undoubtedly the first and most populous of
the empire; and we are posseffed of an authentic record which at-
tests the state of religion in that city about the middle of the third
century, and after a peace of thirty—eight years. The clergy‚ at
that time, confisted of a bishop‚ forty-six prelbyterS, seven deaeons,
as many sub-deacons, forty·two acolythes‚ and fifty readers, exor-
cists, and porters. The number of widows, of the infirm, and of
the poor, who were maintained by the oblations of the faithful,
amounted to fifteen hundred ¹⁶⁹. From reason, as well as from the

analogy of Andoch, we may venture to estimate the Christians of
