But whilst he thus restored the dignity‚ he destroyed the inde-
pendence of the senate. The principles of a free constitution
are irrecoverably lost, when the legissative power is nominated by
the executive.

Before an affembly thus modelled and prepared, Augustus pro-

disguised his ambition. “ He lamented, yet excused, his past

“ his father-'s murder; the humanity of his own nature had some-
“ times given way to the stern laws of necessity, and to a forced
“ connexion with two unworthy co-lleagues: as long, as Antony

“ Roman, and a barbarian queen. He was now at liberty to
“ satisfy his duty and his inclination. He solemnly restored the
“ senate and people to all their ancient rights3 and wished only to
‘⁶ mingle with the crowd of his fellow-citizens‚ and to share the
“ bleflings which he had obtained for his country ⁴.'’

this affembly) to describe the various emotions of the senate 3 those
that were supprefl'ed‚ and those that were affected. It was danger-

more dangerous. The respective advantages of monarehy and a
republic have osten divided speculative inquirers; the present great-
ness of the Roman state, the corruption of manners„ and the licenee

narehy3 and these general views of government were again warped
by the hopes and fears of each individual. Amidst this confufion
