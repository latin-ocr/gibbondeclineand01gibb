THE DECLINE AND FALL

were the first who removed the veil that covered the feeble majesty
of Italy. A numerous body of the Alemanni penetrated across the
Danube, and through the Rhaetian Alps, into the plains of Lom-

bardy, advanced as far as Ravenna, and displayed the viCtorious

banners of barbarians almost in sight of Rome ³⁸. The insult and
the danger rekindled in the senate some sparks of their ancient
virtue. Both the emperors were engaged in far distant wars, Vale-
rian in the east, and Gallienus on the Rhine. All the hopes and
resources of the Romans were in themselves. In this emergency,
the senators resumed the defence of the republic‚ drew out the
Praetorian guards, who had been left to garrison the capital, and
filled up their numbers, by inlisting into the public service, the
stoutest and most willing of the Plebeians. The Alemanni, asto..
nished with the sudden appearance of an army more numerous than
their own, retired into Germany, laden With spoi13 and their retreat
was esteemed as a vietory by the unwarlike Romans ⁸⁹.

NVhen Gallienus received the intelligence that his capital was de-
livered from the barbarians, he was much less delighted‚ than alarmed,
with the courage of the senate, since it might one day prompt them
to reseue the public from domestic tyranny, as well as from foreign
invasion. His timid ingratitude was published to his subjec‘Its, in
an ediec which prohibited the senators from exercifing any military
employment‚ and even from approaching the camps of the legions.
But his fears were groundless. The rich and luxurious nobles,
finking into their natural character, accepted‚‚as a favour, this dis-
graceful exemption from military service; and as long as they were
indulged in the enjoyment of their baths‚ their theatres‚ and their
villas; they cheerfully resigned the more dangerous cares of empire,
to the rough hands of peasants and soldiers ⁹⁰.
