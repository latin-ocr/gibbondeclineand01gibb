THE DECLlNE AND FALL

ries of the republic added less to the wealth than to the power of
Rome. The states of Italy paid their tribute in military service
only, and the vast force both by sea and land, which was exerted in
the Punic wars, was maintained at the cxpence of the Romans them-
selves. That high-spirited people (such is often the generous en-
thusxasm of freedom) cheerfully submittcd to the most exceffive but
voluntary burdens, in the just confidence that they should speedily
cnjoy the rich harvest of their labours. Their cxpectations were
not disappointed. ln the course of a few years, the riches of Syra-
cuse, of Cardmge, of Macedonia, and of Asta, were brought in tri·
umph to Rome, The treasures of Perseus alone amounted to near
two millions sterling, and the Roman people, the sovereign of so
many natione, was for ever delivered from the weight of taxes²³³.
The increasmg revenue of the provinces was found sufficient to
defray the ordinary establilhment of war and government‚ and the
superfluous mass of gold and filver was depofited in the temple of
Saturn‚ and reserved for any unforeseen emergency of the state ⁸⁴.
History has never perhaps suffered a greater or more irreparable
injury‚ than in the loss of the curious register bequeathed by Au-
gustus to the senate, in which that experienced prince so accurately
balanced the revenues and expences of the Roman empire ³³. De-
prived of this clear and comprehensive estimate‚ we are reduced to
colle& a few imperfe& hints from such of the ancIents as have acci-
dentally turned asrde from the splendid to the more useful parts of
history. 'We are informed that, by the conquests of Pompey, the
tributes of Afia were raised from fifty to one hundred and thirty-
five millions of drachms3 or about four millions and a half ster-
