480* *ΓΗ-ΓΕ DECLINE AND FALL
θ’ {nd-¹³· Ι. The fame of Constantine has rendered posterity attentive to the·

m most minute circumstances of his life and actions. The place of
cation’, and his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have been
‘ggssffiffinffl the subjeec not only of literary but of national disputes. Notwith-
A. D. 274· standing the recent tradition, which affigns for her father, a
British king, we are obliged to confess, that Helena was> the
daughter of an innkeeper 8; but at the same time we may defend
the legality of her marriage, against those who have represented her
as the concubine of Constantius ⁹. The great Constantine was most
probably born at Naissus, in Dacia ¹⁰, and it is not surprismg,
that in a family and province distinguished only by the profeffion of

arms, the youth should discover very little inclination to improve his

⁸ This tradition, unknown to the contem-
poraries of Constantine, was invented in the
darkness of monasteries, was embellished by
Jeffrey of Monmouth‚ and the writers of the
xiith century, has been defended by our anti-
›q'uarians of tlie last age, and is seiioussy re-
lated in the ponderous history of England,
compiled by Mr. Carte (vol. i. p. 147.). He
transports, however, the kingdom of Coil,
the imaginary father of Helena, from Effex
to the wall of Antoninus.

9 Eutropius (x. 2.) expreffes, in a few
words, the real truth‚ and the occafion of the
error, “ ex obfiuriori matrimonio ejus filius.”
Zofimus (1. ii. p. 78.) eagerly seized the most
unfavourable repert, and is followed by Oro-
sius (vii. 25.)‚ whose authority is oddly enough
overlooked by the indefatigable but partial
Tillemont.' By insisting on the divorce of
Helena, Diocletian acknowledged her mar-
riage.

¹0 There are three opinions with regard to
the place of Constantine's birth. 1. Our
Englith antiquarians were used to dwell with
rapture on the words of his panegyrist;
“ Britannias illic oriendo nobiles fecisti.''
But this celebrated passage may be referred
nith as much propriety to the accession as to

the nativity of Constantine. 2. Some of the
modern Greeks have ascribed the rhonour of
his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulf
of Nicomedia (Cellarius‚ tom. ii. p. 174.),
which Constantine dignified with the name of
Helenopolis, and Justinian adorned with ma-
ny splendid buildings (Procop. de AEdificiis,
v. 2.). It is· indeed probable enough that
Helena's father kept an inn at Drepanum ς
and that Constantius might lodge there when
he returned from a Perfian embaffy in the
reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering
life of a soldier, the place of his marriage,
and the places where'his children are born,
have very little connection with each other.
3. The claim of Naissus is supported by the
anonymous writer, publiffied at the end of
Ammianus, p. 710, and who in general co-
pied very good materials ς and it is confirmed
by Julius Firmicius (de Astrologid, l. 1.
c. 4.), who flourissied under the reign of Con-
stantine himself. Some objections have been
raised against the integrity of the text, and
the application of the passage of F irmicius ;
but the former is establithed by the best MSS.
and the latter is very ably defended by Lip-
ssus de Magnitudine Romana, 1. iv, c. 11. et
supplement.
