¹14 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C I‘IIVA P· learning, whom Marcus provided for his son, were heard with m-
&pv-*J attention and disgust3 whilst the Moors and Parthians, who taught
him to dart the javelin and to shoot with the bow, found a disciple
who delighted' m his application, and soon equalled the most sszilful
of his instructor& in the steadiness of the eye, and the dexterity of
the hand.
Hunting of The servile crowd, whose fortune depended on their master’s
wild beasts' vices, applauded these ignoble pussuits. The perfidious voice of
flattery reminded him, that by exploits of the same nature, by the
defeat of the Nemaean lion, and the ssaughter of the wild boar of
Erymanthus, the Greeian Hercules had acquired a place among the
gods, and an immortal memory among men. They only forgot
to observe, that in the first ages of society, when the fiercer animales
often dispute with man the poffeffion of an unsettled country, a
successful war against those savages is one of the most innocent
and beneficial labours of heroism. In the civilized state of‘the Ro-
man emphe, the wild beasts had long fince retired from the face of
man, and the neighbourhood of populous cities. To sui-prize them
in their solitary haunts, and to transport them to Rome, that they
might be ssain in pomp by the hand of an emperor, was an enter⁴
prise equally ridiculous for the prince, and oppreffive for the peo-

the glorious resemblance, and stiled himself (as we still read on his
