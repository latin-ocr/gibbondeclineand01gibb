celebrated colony of Lugdunum, or Lyons. The Belgic lay beyond k--v-—d

the Seine, and in more ancient times had been bounded only by the
Rhine; but a little before the age of Caesar, the Germans abusing their
superiority of valour, had occupied a considerable portion of the
Belgio territory. The Roman conquerors very eagerly embraced so
llattering a circumstance, and the Gallie frontier of the Rhine, from
Bafil to Leyden, received the pompous names of the Upper and
the Lower Germany ⁷². Such, under the reign of the Antonines,
were the six provinces of Gaul; the Narbonnese, Aquitaine, the
Celtic, or Lyonnese, the Belgic, and the two Germanies.

W'e have already had occasion to mention the conquest of Britain.

Britain, and to fix the boundary of the Roman province in this
issand. It comprehended all England, Wales, and the Lowlands of
Scotland, as far as the Firths of Dunbarton and Edinburgh. Be-
fore Britain lost her freedom, the country was irregularly divided
between thirty tribes of barbarians, of whom the most considerable
were the Belgae in the West, the Brigantes in the North, the
Silures in South &Valetn and the Iceni in Norfolk and Suffolk⁷³.

and language, Spain, Gaul, and Britain were peopled by the same
hardy race of savages. Before they yielded to the Roman arms,
they often disputed the field, and often renewed the contest. After
their submiffion they constituted the western division of the Eu-
ropean provinces, which extended from the columns of Hercules
to the wall of Antoninus, and from the mouth of the Tagus to the
fiources ofthe Rhine and Danube.

Before the Roman conquest, the country which is now called
Lombardy, was not considered as a part of Italy. lt had been
