out a sedition. The generals and magistrates appointed by Aure- ιον-..ο

liztn continued to execute their ordinary functions, and it is observed,
that a proconsul of Asia was the only considerable person removed
from his office, in the whole course of the interregnum.

An event somewhat similar, but much less authentic, is supposed
to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and
chamelen bore some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was va-
cant during twelve months, till the electiori of a Sabine philosopher,
and the public peace was guardcd in the sanie manner, by the union of
the several orders of the state. But, in the time of Numa and Ro-
mulus, the arms of the people were controlled by the authority of thc
Patricians; and the balance of freedom was easily preserved in a small
and virtuous community ³. The decline of the Roman state, far dif-
ferent from its infixncy, was attended with every circumstance that
could banish from an interregnum the prospe& of obedience and har·
mony3 an immense and tumultuous capital, a wide extent of empire,
the servile equality of despotism, an army of four hundred thousand
mercenaries‚ and the experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, not-
withstanding all these temptatione, the discipline and memory of
Aurelian still restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as

the fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions main· ’

tained their station on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the Imperial
standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the pro-
vinces. A* generous though transient enthusiasrn seemed to ani-
mate the military order; and vve may hope that a few real pa-
triots cultivated the returning friendssiip of the army and the
senate, as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to its
ancient beauty and vigour.
