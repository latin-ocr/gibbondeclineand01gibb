OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Ἶᾟε conspirator-s experienced the rigor of justice, and the aban-
doned princess was punished first with exile, and afterwards with
death ¹⁵.

But the words of the affaffin sunl< deep into the mind εἰ Con-r·-

the whole body of the senate. Those whom he had dreaded as im-
portunate ministers‚ he now suspeeted as secret enemies. The De—
