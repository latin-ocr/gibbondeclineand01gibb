THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΠΧΑ P. exa& register was kept at Alexandria, of all the citizens entitled to
b—-r--d receive the distribution of corn. It was found, that the ancient

number of those comprised between the ages of forty and seventy,
had been equal to the whole sum of claimants‚ from fourteen to
fourscore years of age, who remained alive after the reign of Gal-
lienus ¹⁸². Applying this authentic fa& to the most corre& tables
of mortality‚ it evidently proves, that above half the poople of
Alexandria had periffied3 and could we venture to extend the ana-
logy to the other'provinces, we might suspeet, that war, pestilence‚

and famine, had consumed, in a few years, the moiety of the hu-
man species ¹⁸3.
