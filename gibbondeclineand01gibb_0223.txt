OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 205

and teaches us, that, in a large society, the election of a monarch C {14}st Ρ-
can never devolve to the wisest‚ or to the most numerous, part of z-—v--J
the people. The army is the only order of men sufficiently united
to concur in the same sentiments, and powerful enough to impose
thern on the rest of their fellow—citizens : but the temper of soldicrs,
habituated at once to violence and to ssavery, renders them very
unfit guardians of a legal, ox· even a civil constitution. Justice‚

European monarchies. To the defeet of it, we must attribute the
frequent civil wars, through which an Afiatic Despot is obliged to

cut his 'way to the throne of his fathers. Yet, even in the East,

the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of the
reigning house, and as soon as the more fortunate competitor has re-
moved his brethren‚ by the sword and the bow-string, he no longer
entertains any jealousy of his meaner subjeCrs. But the Roman em-

pire, after the authority of the senate had sunl< into contempt, was

a vast scene οξ confusion. The royal‚ andeven noble, families of

the provinces, had long fince been led in triumph before the car of
the haughty republicans. The ancient families of Rome had
