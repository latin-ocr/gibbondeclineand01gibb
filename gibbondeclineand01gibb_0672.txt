THE DECEINE AND FALL

The total disregard of truth and probability in the representation

aa& of these primitive mai-tyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural

Humanity of .
the Roman nllstake-

magistrates.

The ecclefiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries
ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable
and unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts against the
heretics or the idolaters of their own times. It is not improbable
that some of those persons who vvere raised to the dignities of the
empire, might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace,
and that the cruel dispofition of others might occafionally be
stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal resentment⁶⁶.
But it is certain, and we may appeal to the grateful confeffions of
the first Christians, that the greatest part of those magistrates who
exercised in the provinces the authority of the emperor, or of the
senate, and to whose hands alone the jurisdietion of life and death
was intrusted‚ behaved like men of polistied manners and liberal
educations, who respeeted the rules of justice, and who were conver-
sant with the precepts of philosophy. They frequently declined the
odious rask of persecution, dismissed the charge with contempt,
or suggested to the accused Christian some legal evafion, by which
he might elude the severity of the laws ⁶⁷. Whenever they were

invested with a discretionary power⁶³‚ they used it much less for

’ the Oppi-effion, than for the relief and benefit, of the afflicted church·

They were far from condemning all the Christians who were ae-
cased before their tribunal, and very far from punishing with death

Ruinam, p. 160. 399. Jerome, in his Le-
gend of Paul the Hermit, tells a strange story
ofa young man, who was chained naked on
a bed of flowers, and assaulted by a beautiful
and wantcn courtezan. He quelled the rising
temptation by biting off his tongue.

ω The conversion of his wife provoked
Claudius Herminianus, governor of Cappa-
docia, to treat the Christians with uncommon
severity. Tertullian ad Scapulam, c. 3.

⁶⁷ Tertulliani, in his epistle to the govern-
or of Africa, mentions several remarkable
instances of lenity and forbearance, which
had happened within his knowledge..
