012 THE ROMAN EMPIRE. (321-

gress of Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of C {xj} P.
Christ, his innocent disciples were punished with death by the ι--ψ-θ
sentence of a proconsul of the most amiablc and philosophie cha-
meter, and according to the laws of an emperor, distinguissied by
the wisdom and justice of his general administration. The apo-
logies which were repeatedly addreffed to the suceeffors of Trajan
are filled with the most pathetic complaints, that the Christians
-who obeyed the dietates, and solicited the liberty, of conscience, were
alone, among all the subje&s of the Roman empire, excluded from

the common benefits of their auspicious government. The deaths

, of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care3 and from

the time that Christianity was invested with the supreme power, the
governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in
displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the conduct, of their Pagan
adversaries. To separate (if it be poflible) a few authentic as well as
⁴interesting facts srom an [indigested mass of fiction and error, and
to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the causes, the extent, the
duration‚ and the most important circumstances of the persecutione
,ιο which the first Christians were exposed, is the deliga of the
present Chapter.

The sectaries of a persecuted religion, depressed by fear, animated Inquiry into
with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are seldom in {⁵215ss ¹³¹⁰*
a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or candidly to
appreciate, the motives of their enemies, which often escape the im-
partial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure
distance from the flames of persecution. A reason has been affigned
for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christians,
which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn
from the acknowledged genius of Polytheism. lt has already been
observed, that the religione, concord of the world was principally
support-ed by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of

antiquity expreffed for their respefflve traditions and ceremoniee.
