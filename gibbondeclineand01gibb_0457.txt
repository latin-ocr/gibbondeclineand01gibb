OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

affeEled or poffeffed ς reserved his presence for such occasions as were
worthy of his interpofition, never exposed his person or reputation
to any unnecessary danger, ensured his success by every means that
prudence could suggest, and displayed, with ostentation, the conse-
quences of his viCtory. In wars of a more difficult nature, and
more doubtful event, he employed the rough valour of Maximian,
and that faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own viCtories to
the vvise counsels and auspicious influence of his benefaemr. But

sons the defence of the Danube and of the Rhine. The vigilant
Galerius was never reduced to the neceflity of vanquishing an army
of barbatiane on the Roman territory ³⁵. The bmve and active
Constantius delivered Gaul from a very furious inroad of the
Alemann13 and his vietories of Langres ancl Vindonissa appear

with difficulty towards Langres ; but, in the general consternation,
the citizens refused to open their gates, and the wounded prince

news of his distress,' the Roman troops hastened from all sides to
his relief, and before the evening he had satisfieri his honour and
revenge by the ssaughter of srx thousand Alemanni ³⁶. From tlte
monuments of those times, the obscure traces of several other vieto-
