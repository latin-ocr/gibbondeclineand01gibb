THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HXs‘* P. approach they raised the siege, but with a defign only of marching
k——v--a away to a conquest of greater importance, the fiege of Philippopolis,

a city of Thrace, founded by the father of Alexander, near the
foot of mount Haemus ³¹. Decius followed them through a diffia
cult country, and by forced marches; but when he imagined him-
self at a considerable distance from the rear of the Goths‚ Cniva
turned with rapid sury on his pursuers. The camp of the Romans
was surprised and pillaged, and, for the first time, their emperor fied
in disorder before a troop of half-armed barbarians. After a
long refistance, Philippopolis, destitute of succour, was taken by
storm. An hundred thousand persons are reported to have been
maffacred in the sack of that great city ³². Many prisoner& of eon-
sequence became a· valuable acceffion to the spoil, and Priscus, a
brother of the late emperor Philip, blushed not to assume the
purple under the protection of the barbarous enemies of Rome ³³.
The time, however, consumed in that tedious siege, enabled Decius
to revive the courage, restore the discipline, and recruit the numbers
of his troops· He intercepted several parties of Carpi, and other
Germane, who were hastening to share the victory of their country-
men ³⁴, intrusted the paffes of the mountains to Officers of approved
valour and fidelity ³⁵, repaired and strengthened the fortifications of
the Danube, and exerted his utmost vigilance to oppose‘either the
progress or the retreat of the Goths. Encouraged by the return of
fortune, he anxioussy waited for an opportunity to retrieve, by a
great and decifive blow, his own glory, and that of the Roman arms ³⁶.
