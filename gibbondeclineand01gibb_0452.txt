wealth of Caraufius was, on this occafion, very justly considered
as an evidence of his guilt; and Maximian had already given orders
for his death. - But the crafty Menapian foresaw and prevented the
severity of the emperor. By his liberality he had attached to his
fortunes the fleet which he commanded, and secured the barbarians
in his interest. From the port of Boulogne he sailed over to Britain,
persuaded the legIon, and the auxiliarIes which guarded that Issand,
to embrace his party, and boldly assuming, with the Imperial
purple, the title of Augustus, defied the justice and the arms of
his injured sovereign ²⁶.

When Britain was thus dismembered from the empire, its im-
portance was senfibly felt, and its loss fincerely lamented. The

Romans celebrated, and perhaps magnifieri, the extent of that noble
issand, provided on every fide with convenient harbour53 the tem-
perature of the climate, and the fertility of t‘he soil, alike adapted
for the production of corn or of vines; the valuable minerals with
which it abounded3 its rich pastures covered with innumerable
flocks, and its vvoods free from Wild beasts or venomous serpents.

Britain, whilst they confesse& that such a province well desei-ved to
