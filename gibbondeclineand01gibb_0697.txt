OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

and his colleagues frequently conferred the most important offices
on those persons, who avowed their abhorrence for the worship of
the gods, but who had displayed abilities proper for the service of
the state. The bishops held an honourable rank in their respective*
provinces, and were treated with distinction and respect, not only by
the people, but by the magistrates themselves. Almost in every
city, the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the in-

and capacious edifices were &edred for the public worffiip of the
faithful. The corruption of manners and principles, so forcibly
lamented by Eusebius ¹³⁵, may berconfid‘ered, not only as a conse-
quence, but as a proof, of the liberty, which the Christians enjoyed
and abused under the reign of Diocletian. Prosperity had relaxed
the nerves of discipline. Fraud, envy, and malice, prevailed in every
congregation. The presbyters aspired to the episcopal office, which
every day became an object more worthy of their ambition. The
bishops, who contended with> each other for ecclefiastical pre-
eminenee, appeared by their conduec to claim a secular and tyrannical
power in the church3 and the lively faith which still distinguished
the Christians from the Gentiles, w'as shewn much less in their lives,
than in their controverfial writings.

Notwithstanding this seeming security, an attentive observer
might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a
more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured. The
zeal and rapid progress of the Christians awakened the Polytheists
from their supine indifference in the cause of those deities, whom
custorn and education had taught them to revere. The mutual pro-
vocations of a religione> war, which had already continued above
two hundred years, exasperated the animolity of the contending
