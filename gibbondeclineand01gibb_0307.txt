ROM the great secular games celebrated by Philip, to the
death of the emperor Gallienus, there elapsed twenty years
of {hante and missortune. During that calamitous period, every
instant of time was marked, every province of the Roman world

was afflicted, by barbarous invaders and military tyrants‚ and the 2

ruined empire seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its
diffolution. The confusion of the times, and the scarcity of authen-
tic memoriale, oppose equal difficulties to the historian, who attempts
to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration. Surrounded
with imperfe& fragments, always concise, often obscure, and some-
times contradicffiry, he is reduced to collect, to compare, and to
conjecture: and though he ought never to place his conjestures
in the rank of fadis, yet the knowledge of human nature, and of
the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained paffions, might, on
some occasions, supply the want of historical materiale.

There is not, for instance, any difficulty in conceiving, that the
succeffive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the ties
of allegiance between the prince and people3 that all the generals
of Philip were disposed to imitate the example of their master, and
that the caprice of armies, long slnCe habituated to frequent and vio-
lent revolufions, might every day raise to the throne the most obscure
of their fellow-soldiers. History can only add, that the rebellion
against the emperor Philip broke out in the summer of the year
two hundred and forty·nine, among the legions of Maefia ; and that
