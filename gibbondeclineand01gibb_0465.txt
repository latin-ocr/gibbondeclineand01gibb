implored the protection of Sapor. The emperor of China claimed Μ

the fugitive, and alleged the rights of sovereignty. The Perfian
monarch pleadcd the laws of hospitality, and with some difficulty
avoided a war, by the promise that he would baniIh Mamgo to the
uttermost parts of the Weſtr a punishment, as he described it, not
less dreadful than death itself. Armenia was chosen for the place
of exile, and a large district was affigned to the Scythian horde, on
which they might feed their flocks and herds, and remove their en·
campment from one place to another, according to the different
seasons of the year. They were employed to repel the invasion of

Tiridates; but their leader, after weighing the obligations and in-
juries which he had received from the Persian monarch, resolved to

abandon his party. The Armenian prince‚ who was well acquainted

tinguished respe&; and by admitting him into his confidence, ac-
quired a brave and faithful servant, who contributed very effectually

to his restoration ⁶⁰.

For a while, fortune appeared to favour the enterprifing valour of The Perfians

Tiridates. He not only expelled the enemies of his family and coun- ἓξὲξ r-

revenge he carried his arms, or at least his incurfions‚ into the heart
of Assyria. The historian, who has preserved the name of Tiridates
from oblivion, celebrates, with a degree of national enthufiasm‚ his
personal prowess; and, in the true spirit of eastern romance, de-
'scribes the giants and the elephants that fell beneath his invincible arm.
It is from other information that we discover the distra&ed state ofthe
Perfian monarchy, to which the king of Armenia was indebted for
some part of his advantages. The throne was disputed by the 3η]-

bition of contending brothers 3 and Hormuz, after exerting without
