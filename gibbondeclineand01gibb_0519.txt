OF'THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

happiness as the condition of the times was capable of· receiving,
Italy and Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant as con-
temptible as he was odious. The zeal of flattery and faffion has
indeed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the vanquissred to
the glory of their successful rivals; but even those writers who
have revealed, with the most freedom and pleasure, the faults of
Constantine, unanimoussy confess, that Maxentius was cruel, ra-
pacious, and profligate 4². He had the good fortune to suppress
a ssight rebellion inAfrica. The governor and a few adherents
had been guilty3 the province suffered for their crime. The
flourishing cities of Cirtha and Carthage‚ and the whole extent
of that fertile country, were wasted by fise and sword. The abuse
of vi&ory was followed by the abuse of law and justice. A for-
midable army of sycophants and delators invaded Africa3 the rich
and the noble were easily conviffi'oed of a connexion with the
rebels; and those among them who experienced the emperor's
clemency, were only punished by the confiscation of their estates ⁴³.
So signal a victory was celebrated by a magnificent triumph, and
Maxentius exposed to the eyes of the people the spoils and cap-
tives of a Roman province. The state of the capital was no less
deserving of compaffion than that of Africa. The wealth of Rome
supplied an inexhaustible fund for his vain and prodigal expences,
and the ministers of his revenue were sszilled in the arts of rapine.
It was under his reign that the method of exaCting a 'Ji-ee gist
from the senators was first invented ς and as the sum was insenfibly
increased, the pretences oflevying it, a vid’tory, a birth, a marriage, or
an Imperial consulship, were proportionably multiplied ⁴⁴. Maxentius
