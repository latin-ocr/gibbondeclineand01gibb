tion as the soil has been cultivated, the air has become more tem-
perate. Canada, at this day, is an exa& picture of ancient Ger-
many. Although fituated in the same parallel with the finest pro-
vinces of France and England, that country experiences the most
rigorous cold. The rein deer are very numerOUS, the ground is
covered with deep and lasting snow, and the great river of St.
Lam-enee is regularly frozen, in a season when the waters of the
Seine and the Thames are usually free from ice ⁷. ’

It is difficult to ascertain, and easy to exaggerate, the influenee of
the climate of ancient Germany over the minds and bodies of the
natives. Many writers have supposed, and most have allowed,
though, as it ssxould seem, without any adequate proof, that the
rigorous cold of the North was favourable to long life and genera-
tive vigour, that the women vvere more fruitful, and the human
species more prolific, than in warmer or more temperate climates ⁸-
WVe may affert, with greater confidence, that the keen air of Ger-
many formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives, who
were, in general, of a more lofty stature than the people of the
South ⁹, gave them a kind of strength better adapted to violent
exertions than to patient labour, and inspired them with constitu-
tional bravery, which is the result of nerves and spirits. The
severity of a winter campaign, that chilled the courage of the

Roman troops, was scarcely felt by these hardy children of the
North ¹⁰, who, in their turn, were unable to refist the summer heats‚
