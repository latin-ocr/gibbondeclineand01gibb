pania, to the foot of mount Caucasus, he sunk under the unaccus-
tomed hardlhips of a military life. The fatigues of the body were
aggravated by the cares of the mind. For awhile, the angry and selfish
paffions of the soldiers had been suspended by the enthusiasm of
public virtue. They soon broke out with redoubled violence, and

mild and amiable character served only to inspire contempt, and he
was inceffantly tormented with factions which he could not assuage,
and by demands which it was impossible to satisfy. Whatever fiat-

orders, Tacitus soon was convinced, that the licentiousness of the

army disdained the feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was
hastcned by anguish and disappointment. It may be doubtful
