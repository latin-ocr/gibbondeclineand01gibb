THE DECLINE AND FALL

s-Xfl-L-o his disordered fancy often beheld the angry forms of his father

and his brother rising into life, to threaten and upbraid him ²⁵.
The consciousness of his crime should have induced him to convince
mankind, by the virtues of his reign, that the bloody deed had been
the involuntary effe& of fatal neceffity. But the repentanee of Cara-
calla only prompted him to remove from the world whatever could*
remind him of his guilt, or recal the memory of his murdered bro-

mother in the company of several noble matrons, weeping over the
untimely fate of her younger son. The jealous emperor threatened
them with instant death; the sentence was executed against Fadilla,
the last remaining daughter of the emperor Marcus; and even the
afflicted Julia was obliged to silence h-er lamentations, to suppress
her fighs, and to receive the affaffin with smiles of joy and appro-
bation. It was computed that, under the vague appellation of the
friends of Geta, above twenty thousand persons of both sexes suf-
fered death. His guards and freedmen, the ministers of his seri-
ous bufiness, and the companions of his looser hours, those who by-
his interest had been promoted to* any commands in the army or
provinces, with the long-conneoed chain of their dependantS, were'
included in the proscription3 which endeavoured to reach every one
who had maintained the smallest correspondence with Geta, who
lamented his death, or who even mentioned his name ²⁶. Helvius
