It is not easy to conceive from what motives a spirit of persecu-
tion could introduce itself into the Roman councils. The magisss-
trates could not be aestuated by a blind, though honest bigotry‚
since the magistrates were themselves philosophers; and the schools
of Athens had given laws to the senate. They could not be impelled
by ambition or avarice, as the temporal and ecclefiastical powers
were united in the same hands. The pontiffs were chosen among
the most illustrious of the senator83 and the office of Supreme Pon-
