Those among them who condescend to mention the Christians‚ ι--ν--Α
consider them only as obstinate and perverse cnthufiasts‚ who exa&ed
an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines, without being

It is at least doubtful whether any of these philosophers perused Their ΠΕ-
the apologies which the primitive Christians repeatedly publilhed gheeegyoffro-

lamented that such a cause was not defended by abler advocates.

They expose‚ with superfluous wit and eloquence, the extrava-

ing the innocence and sufferings of their injured brethren. But
when they would demonstrate the divine origin of Christianity, they

fluence, when it is addreffed to those who neither understand nor
respec't the mosaic dispensation and the propheti-c style¹⁹². In the
