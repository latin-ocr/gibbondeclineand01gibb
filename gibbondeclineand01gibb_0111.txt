or‘THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 93

with his own applause‚ and the acclamations of the soldiers, whose C fh? P·
consent had been secured by an immense donative, the new Caesar ⁴¹ μαψ-,ι
was ravished from his embraces by an untimely death. He left
only one son. Hadrian commended the boy to the gratitude of the
Antonines. He was adopted by Pius; and, on the accession of
Marcus, was invested with an equal ssiare of sovereign power.
