verus contented with such a measure of taxation‚ as had appeared
sufficient to his moderate predeceffors. Instead of a twentieth, he
exacted a tenth of all legacies and inheritances; and during his
reign (for the ancient proportion was restored after his death) he
crushed alike every part of the empire under the weight of his
iron sceptre ¹¹⁴.

When all the provincials became liable to the peculiar impositions
of Roman citizens, they seemed to acquire a legal exemption from the
tributes which they had paid in their former condition of subjects.
Such were not the maxims of government adopted by Caracalla and
his pretended son. The-old as well as the new taxes were, at the same
time, levied in the provinces. It was reserved for the virtue of Alexan·

by reducing the tributes to a thirtieth part of the sum exaeced at the
time of his acceffion ¹¹⁵. It is impossible to conjedmre the motive that
engaged him to spare so trifling a remnant of the public evil; but
the noxious weed, which had not been totally eradicated‚ again sprang

this history, we shall be too often summoned to explain the land-tax,
the capitation, and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil‚ and
meat, which were exaaed from the provinces, for the use of the
court, the army, and the capital.

As ‘long as Rome and Italy were respeaed as the centre of govern-
ment, a national spirit was preserved by the ancient, and insensibly
imbibed by the adopted, citizens. The principal commands of the
army were filled by men who had received a liberal education, were
