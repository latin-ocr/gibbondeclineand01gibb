who could alledge any hereditary claim to the honours of the Julian
line. But, at the time of his death, the praefice of a century had
inseparably conne&ed those appellations with the Imperial dignsty,
and they have been preserved by a long sueceffion of emperors,
Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Germans, from the fall of the re-

duced. The sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the
monarch, whilst the name of Caesar was more freely communicated
to his relations 3 and, from the reign of Hadrian, at least, was ap-

the presumptive heir of the empire.

The tender respect of Augustus for a free constitution which he
had destroyed, can only be explained by an attentive confideration
of the character of that subtle tyrant. A cool head, an unfeeling
heart, and a cowardly disposition, prompted him, at the age of
