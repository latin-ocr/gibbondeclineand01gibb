THE DECLINE AND FALL

Suspicious princes often promote the last of mankind from a vain

persuasion, that those who have no dependence‚ except on their
favour, will have no attachment, except to the person of their

benefaciam Cleander, the successor of Perennis, wa's a Phrygiari
by birth} of a marion, over whose stubborn, but servile temper,
blows only could prevail20. He had been sent from his native

-country to Rome, in the capacity of a ssave. As a [lave he en-

and the great principle of his administration. The rank of Consul,

cumulated more wealt'n than had ever yet been possessed by any

freedman²². Commodus was perfeffly satisfied with the magni-
ficent presente which the artful courtier laid at his feet in the most'
