the groveling or visronary sehemes of superstition. Fasling and
celibacy, the common means of purchafing the divine favour,

he condemns with abhorrence, as a criminal rejection of the best
gifts of providence. The saint, iu the Magian religion, is obliged
to beget children, to plant useful trees, to destroy noxious animals,
