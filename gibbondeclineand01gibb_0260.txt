But the malice of Ahriman has long slnce pierced Ormzffd’s egg;
or, in other words, has violated the harmony of his-works. Since
tha't fatal irrupfion, the most minute articles of good and evil
are intimately intermingled and agitated together3 the rankest
poisons spring up amidst the most salutary plant83 deluges, earth-
quakes, and conflagrations, attest the confliCt of Nature, and the
little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and misforrunc.
Whilst the rest of human kind are led away captives in the chains
of their infernal enemy, the faithful Persian alone reserves his
religious adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd, and fights
under his banner of light, in the full confidence, that he shall, in
the last day, share the glory of his triumph. At that decifive
period, the enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power
of Ormusd superior to the furious malice of his rival. Ahrirnan and
his followers, disarmed and subdued, will fink into their native
darkness3 and virtue will maintain the eternal peace and harmony
of the universe ¹¹.

“ highest mountains are the places chosen for sacrifices. Hymns
