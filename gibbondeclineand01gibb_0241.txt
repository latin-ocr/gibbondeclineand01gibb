OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

that the operations of some foreign war deferred the Italian expedi-
tion till the ensuing spring. From the prudent condud'c of Maximin,
we may learn that the savage features of his charaeter have been ex·-
aggerated by the pencil of party, that his paflions, however impetu-
ouS, submitted to the force of reason, and that the barbarian poffeffed
something of the generous spirit of Sylla, who subdued the enemies
of Rome, before he suffered himself to revenge his private injuries ³⁵.

When the troops of Maximin, advancing in excellent order,
arrived at the foot of the Julian Alps, they were terrified by the
filence and desolation that reigned on the frontiers of Italy. The
villages and open towns had been abandoned on their approach by
the inhabitants, the cattle was driven away, the provisions removed,

or destroyed, the bridges broke down, nor was any thing left
which could afford either shelter or sublistence to an invadet. Such
had been the wise orders of the generals of the senate; whose de·

sign was to protraft the war, to ruin the army of Maximin by

the ssow operation of famine, and to consume his strength in the
fieges of the principal cities of Italy, which they had plentifully
stored with men and provisions from the deserted country. Aquileia
received and withstood the first shock of the invasion. The streams
