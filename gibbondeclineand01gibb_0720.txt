particularly from the cities of Nicomedia, Antioch, and Tyre, which

of justice rather than the difflues of his clemency3 expreffed their

lie obtained from the citizens of Tyre is still extant. He praises
their zeal and devotion in tei-ms of the highest satisfaction, descants on
the obstinate iinpiety of the Christians, and betrays, by the readiness
with which he consents to their banishment, that he considered him-

self as receiving, rather than as conferring, an obligation. The priests
as well as the magistrates were empowered to enforce the execution.-
