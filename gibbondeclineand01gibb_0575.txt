OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

infernal spirit, Homer and Virgil were the most eminent of his
servants, and the beautiful mythology which pervades and animates
the compofitions of their genius, ‚is'destined to celebrate the glory
of the daemons. Even the common language of Greece and Rome
abounded with familiar but impious exp1·effi0ns‚ which the im-
¹prudent Christian might too carelessly mter, or too patiently
hear 4⁸.

The dangerous temptations which on every side lurked in
ambush to surprise the unguarded believer, affailed him with re-
doubled violence on the days of solemn festivals. So artfully
were they framed and disposed throughout the year, that super-
stition¹ always wore the appearance of pleasure‚ and often of vir-
tue ⁴⁹.—— Some of the most sacred festivals in the Roman ritual were
destined to salute the new calends of january with vows of public
and private felicity, to indulge the pious remembrance of the dead
and living, to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property, to hail,
on the return of spring, the genial powers of fecundity, to'per-
petuate the two memorable aeras of Rome, the foundation of the
city, and that of the republic, and to restore, during the humane
license of the Saturnalia, the primitive equality of mankind. Some
idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christians for such
impious ceremonies, by the serupulous delicacy which they dis-
‚played on a much less alarming occasion. On days of general
festivsty, it was the custom of the ancients to adorn their doors
with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown their heads
with a garland of flowers. This innocent and elegant praefice
might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil institution. But
