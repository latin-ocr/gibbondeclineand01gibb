OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

disciplined evolutions which harmonize and animate a confused
multitude, were unknown to the Perfians. They were equally un-
{killed in the arts of constructing, befieging‚ or defending regular
fortifications. They trusted more to their numbers than to their
courage; more to their courage than to their discipline. The infantry
was a half-armed spiritless crowd of peasants‚ levied in haste by the
allurements of plunder, and as easily dispersed by a vistory as by a
defeat. The monarch and his nobles transported into the camp
the pride and luxury of the seraglio. Their military operations
were impeded by a useless train of women, eunuchs, horses, and ca-

was often separated or destroyed by an unexpected famine ⁵⁶.

But the nobles of perfia, in the bosom ofluxury and despotism,
preserved a strong sense of personal gallantry and national honour.
From the age of seven years they were taught to speak truth, to
shoot with the bow, and to ride; and it was universally confeffed,

under the monarch's eye, praeitised their exercises in the gare of his
palace, and were severely trained up to the habits of temperanee and
obedience‚ in their long and laborious parties of hunting. In
every province, the satrap maintained a like school of military
virtue. The Persian nobles (so natural is the idea of feudal tenures)
received from the king’s bounty lands and houses, on the condition
of their service in war. They were ready on the first summons to
mount on horseback, with a martial and splendid train of follow-
ers, and to join the numerous bodies of guards, who were care·
sully selected from among the most robust ssaves, and the bravest ad-
