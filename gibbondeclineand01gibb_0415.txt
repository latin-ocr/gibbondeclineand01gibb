OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

often checked the cruelty of his master. Tacitus, who defired by
the abilitics of his generals to supply his own deficiency of military
talents, named him eommander in chief of all the eastern province8‚
with five times the usu-al salary, the promise of the consulship, and the
hope ofa triumph. YVhen Probus ascended the Imperial throne, he
was about forty-four years of age ²4; in the full posseffion of his fame,
of the love of the army, and ofa mature vigour of mind and body.
His acknowledged merit, and the success of his arms against
Florianus, left him without an enemy or a competitor. Yet, if we
may credit his own profeffions, very far from being defirous of the
empire, he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance. “ But
“ it is no longer in my power,'’ says Probus, in a private letter,
“ to‘ lay down a title so full of envy and of danger. I must con-
“ tinue to personate the character which the soldiers have imposed
‘⁴ upon me²⁵.'’ His dutiful address to the senate displayed the
sentiments‚ or at least the language, of a Roman patriot: “ When
“·'y0u elected one of your order, conscript fathers! to succeed the
“ emperor Aurelian, you acted in a manner suitable to your justice
“ and wisdorn. For you are the legal sovereigns of the world,
“ and the *power which you derive from your ancestors, will de-
“· scend to your posterity. Happy would it have been, if Flori-
“‘ anus, instead of usurping the purple of his brother, like a pri-
“ vate inherstance, had expected what your majesty might deter-
“ mine, either in his¹ favour, or in that of any other person. The
“ prudent soldiers have punished his rassmess. To me they have
“ offered the title of Augustus. But I submit to your clemency my
“ pretenfions and my merits²⁶.’' When this respefiful epistle was
