their theory. The general complaints of intense fr0st‚ and eter- C fixA P-

nal winter, are perhaps little to be regarded, smee we have no me- κων-,ι

thod of reducing to the accurate standard of the thermomcter‚ the
feeling-s, or the expressions, of an orator, born in the happier regions
of Greece or Asia. But I shall sele& two remarkable circumstances
of a less equivocal nature. 1. The great rivers which covered the
Roman provinces, the Rhine and the Danube, were frequently srozen
over, and capable of supporting the most enormous weights. The
barbarians, who often chose that severe season for their immam,
transported‚ without apprehenfion or danger, their numerous armies,
their cavalry, and their heavy waggons, over a vast and solid bridge
of ice ³. Modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phae-
nomenon. 2. The rein decr, that useful animal, from whom the
savage of the North derives the best comforts of his dreary life, is
of a constitution that supports, and even requires, the most intense
cold. He is found on the rock of Spitzberg‚ within ten degrees of
the Pole ;v he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and Siberia3
but at present he cannot subfist, much less multiply, in any country
to the south of the Baltic ⁴. In the time of Caesar, the rein deer, as
well as the elk‚ and the wild bun, was a native of the Hercynian
⁷ forest, which· then overshadovved a great part of Germany and Po-

land ⁵. The modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes ⁴

of the diminution of the cold. These immense woods have been
gradually cleared, which intercepted from the earth the rays
