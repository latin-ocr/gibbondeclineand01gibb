munity. The situation of Sicily preserved it from the barbarians;
nor could the disarmed province have supported an usurper. The
sufferings of that once flourishing and still fertile issand, were in-
flicted by bafer hands. A licentious crowd of ssaves and peasants
reigned for a while over the plundered country, and renewed the

various mixture of natione, united the vanity and inconstancy of
the Greeks, with the superstition and obstinacy of the Egyptians.
