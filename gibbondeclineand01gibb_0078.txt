Capua and Corinth, soon recovered all the advantages which can
be separated from independent sovereignty. IV. The provinces
of the east present the contrast of Roman magnificence with
Turkish barbarism. The ruins of antiquity scattered over un-
cultivated fields, and ascribed, by ignorance, to the power of
magic, scarcely afford a shelter to the oppressed peasant or wan·-

alone contained five hundred populous cities ⁷⁹, enriched with all
the gifts of nature, and adorned with all the refinements of art.
Eleven cities of Afia had once disputed the honour of dedicating a
