THE DECLINE AND FALL

It is almost unnecessary to remark, that the civil distractions of
the emphe, the license of the soldiers, the inroads of the barbari·-
ans, and the progress of despotism, had proved very unfavourable
to genius and even to learning. The succeffion of Illyrian princes
restored the empne, without restoring the sciences. Their mili-
tary education was not calculated to inspire them with the love of
letters; and even the mind of Diocletiano, however adtive and
capacious in bufiness, was totally uninformed by study or specu·
lation. The profeflions of law and physic are of such common
use and certain profit, that they will always secure a sufficient
number of praclitioners, endowed with a reasonable degree of abili-
ties and knowledge; but it does not appear that the studems in
those two faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who fiourissied
within that period. The voice of poetry was filent. History was÷
reduced to dry and confused abridgments, alike destitute of amuse-
ment and instruffion. A languid and affected eloquence was still
retained in the pay and ser-vice of the emperors, who encouragedss
not any arts except those which contributcd to the gratification of
their pride, or the defence of their power ¹²³0

The declining age of learning and of mankind* is marked,
however, by the rise and rapid progr-ess of the new Platonists‚
The school of Alexandria si-lenced those of Athens; and the ancient*
secls enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fafflionable
renchers, who recommendedrtheir system by the novelty of their rne-
thod, and the austerity of their manners. Several of these masters,
Ammonius, Plotianis, Aurelius, and Porphyry ¹⁶²⁴, were men of pro-
