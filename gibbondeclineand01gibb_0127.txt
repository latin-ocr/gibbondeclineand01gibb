nister‘s death, as the only redress of their grievances¹⁷. This
presumption of a distant army, and their discovery of the weakness
of government‚ was a sure presage of the most dreadful con-
vulfions.

The negligence of the public administration was betrayed soon
afterwards, by a new disorder which arose from the smallest begin-
nings. A spirit of desertion began to prevail among the troops 3 and
the deserters, 'instead of seeking their safety in ssight or conceal-
ment, infested the highways. Maternus, a private soldier, of a
daring boldness above hisstation, colleered these hands of robbers
into a little army, set open the prisons, invited the ssaves to affert
their freedorn, and plundered with i‘mpunity the rich and defence·
less eities of Gaul and Spain. The governors of the provinces, who
had long been the spectators, and perhaps the partners, of his de-
predations, were, at length, roused from their supine indolence by

the threatning commands of the emperor. Maternus found that?

he was encompaffed, and forefaw that he must be overpowered. A
great effort of despair was his last resource. He ordered his fol-
lowers to disperse, to pass the Alps i'n small parties and various
disguises‚ and to affemble at Rome, during the licentioris tumult of
the festival of Cybele ¹³. To murder Commodus, and to ascend
the vacant throne, was the ambition of no vulgar robber. His
measures were so ably concerted, that his concealed' troops already
filled the streets of Rome. The envy of an accomplice discovered·
and ruined this singular enterprise, in the moment when it was ripe
for execution ¹⁹.
