faintly condemned in a prince of nineteen years of age.

During the three first years of his reign, the forms, and even
the spirit, of the old administration was maintained by those faithful

whose wisdom and integrity Commodus still entertained a relu&ant

a senator of distinguished merit and unshaken loyalty; but among
the crowd of her lovers (for the imitated the manners of Faustina)
she found men of desperate fortunes and wild ambition‚ who were

prepared to serve her more violent, as wellas her tender paflions.
