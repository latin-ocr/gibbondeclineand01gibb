language of inspiration, and the effects of accident or contrivance
were ascribed to supernatural causes. The recent experience of
genuine miracles should have instruered the Christian world in the
ways of providenoe, and habituated their eye (if we may use a

primitive Christiane perpetually trod on mystie ground, and their
minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most extraor-
dinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every side they
