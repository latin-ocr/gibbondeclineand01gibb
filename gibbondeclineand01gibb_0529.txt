OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Shame at length supplied the place of courage, and forced him to
take the field. He was unable to sustain the contempt of the Roman
people. The circus resounded with their indignant clamomrs, and
they tumultuoussy besieged the gates of the palme, reproaching the
pusillanimity of their indolent sovereign, and celebrating the heroic
spirit of Constantine ⁶³. Before Maxentius left Rome, he consulted
the Sibylline books. The guardians of these ancient oracles were as
well versed in the arts of this world, as they were ignorant of the
secrets of fate; and they returned him a very prudent answer,
which might adapt itself to the event, and secure their reputation
whatever should be the chance of arms ⁶⁴. ’

The celerity of Constantine's march has been compared to the
rapid conquest of Italy by the first of the Caesars; nor is the flatter-
ing parallel repugnant to the truth of history, since no more than
fifty-eight days elapsed between the surrender of Verona ancl the
final decision of the war. Constantine had always apprehended that
the tyrant would consult t-he dictares of sear, and perhaps of pru-
denee3 and that, instead of risking his last hopes in a general en-

His ample magazines secured him against the danger of famine;
and as the situation of >Constantine admitted not of delay, he might
have been reduced to the sad necessity of destroying with fire and
sword the Imperial city, the noblest reward of his vi&ory, and the de-

liverance of which had been the motive‚ or rather indeed the pretence,
of the civil war ⁶⁵. It was with equal surprise and pleasuie, that on hies
