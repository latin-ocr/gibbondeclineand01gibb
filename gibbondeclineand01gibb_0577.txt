the fatal stroke of our diffolution releases us from the calamities of ι-η-ι
life; and that those can no longer suffer who no longer exist.
Yet there were a few fages of Greece „and Rome who had conceived
a more exalted, and, in some respects, a justet idea ‘of human
nature; though it must be confessed, that, in the sublime inquiry,
their reason had been often guided by their iinagination‚ and that their
imagination had been prompted by their vanity. When they
viewed with complacency the extent of their own mental powers,
when they exercised the various faculties of memory, of fancy,
ancl of judgment‚ in the most profound speculations‚ or the most
important labours, and when they refleeted on the desire of fame,
which transported thern into future ages, far beyond the bounds
of death and of the grave3 they were unwilling to confound them-
selves with the beasts of the field, or to suppose, that a being,
for whose dignity they entertained the most sincere admiration,
could be limited to a spot of earth, and to a few years of duration.
With this favourable prepoffeffion they summoned to their aid the
science, or rather the language, of Metaphyfics. They soon dis--
covered, that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the
operations of the mind, the human soul must consequently be a
substance distinet from the body, pure, simple, and spiritual, in-
capable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher degree of
virtue and happiness after the release from its corporea] prison.
From these specious and noble principles, the philosophers who
trod in the footsteps of Plato, deduced a very unjustifiable conclu-

past eternity of the human soul, which they were too apt to con·
fider as a portion of the infinite and sels-existing spirit, which per-2
vades and sustains the universe ⁵². A doetrine thus removed
