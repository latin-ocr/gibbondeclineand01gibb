of letters and of devotion, which afford so many resources in

but he had preserved, or at least he soon recovered, a taste for the
most innocent as well as natural pleasures, and his leisure hours
were sufficiently employed in building, planting, and gardening.

His answer to Maximian is deservedly celebrated. He was solicited His philost»,

by that restless old man to reaffume the reins of government and
the Imperial purple. He rejected the temptation with a smile of
pity‚ calmly observing‚ that if he could ¹shew Maximian the cab-
bages which he had planted with his own hands at Salona, he
should no longer be urged to relinquilh the enjoyment of happiness
for the pursuit of power ¹¹². In his conversations with his friends,
he frequently acknowledged‚ that of all arts, the most difficult was
the art of reigning ; and he expreffed himself on that favourite topic
with a degree of warnith which could be the result only of ex-
perience. ‘⁶ How often, was he accustomed to say, is it the interest

“ sovereign. Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity, the
“ truth is concealed from his knowledge3 he can see only with
“ their eyeS‚ he hears nothing but their misrepresentations. He
“ confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness, and
-“ disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his subjeets.
“ By such infamous arts‚ added Diocletian‚ the best and wisest
“ princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers¹¹³.''
