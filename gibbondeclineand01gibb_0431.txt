OF THE ROMAN· EMPIRE. 4¹1

Persians expreffed their defire' of being-introduced> to th'e presence of C fo} Ρ-
’ the Roman emperor. [They were a't leng‘th con'duaed to a soldier, u--c-ssffl
who was seated on theg'rass. 2A piene ofs-stale bacon· and afew hard

pease composed his supper. A coarse woolle'n garment of purple

was· the only circumstance that announced his dignity.' The con-‘-

ference was condueced with the sanie disregardof courtlyeleganc‘e'.

sured the« ambaffador'ss-'than unless {their fmaster acknowledged the
superiority of Rome, he would speedily render Persia as naked of

trees, as his own head was destitute of hair⁷³. Notwithstanding

some traces of art and preparation, vv'em'ay discover in this scene the

manners of Carus, andsthe severe simplicity which the martial

princes, who suceeeded Gallienus, had already restored in the Roman

'camps. The ministers of the great‘king trembled and retired.

The threats of Carus were not without effect. He ravaged His viatorio:
Mesopotamia, cut in pieces whatever opposed his passage, made ἓῗέαῗζὲἒέἷὴ,
'himself master of the great cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon (which
Ἴ seem to have surrendered without refistance), and carried his vic-
torious arms beyond the Tigris ⁷⁴. . He had seized the favourable
moment for an invasion. The Perfian councils were distrafi'ced by
domestic factions, and the greater part of their forces were detained on
the frontiers of India. Rome and the East received with transport

the news of such important advantages. Flattery and hope painted,

¹ in the most lively colours, the fall of Persia, the conquest of Arabia,

the submiffion of Egypt, and a lasting deliverance from the inroads
of the Scythian nations ⁷⁵. But the reign of Carus was destined to
expose the vanity of predictions. They were scarcely uttered A· D. 283·
