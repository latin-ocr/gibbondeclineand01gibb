THE DECLINE AND FALL

But if we except the doubtful atchievements of Semiramis. Zenobia
is perhaps the only female, whose superior genius broke through
the servile indolence imposed on her fex by the climate and manners,
of Asia ⁵⁴. She claimed her descent from thc Macedonian kings of
Egypt, equalled in beauty her ancestor Cleopatra,¹ and far surpassed
that princess in chastity ⁵⁵ and valour. Zenobia was esteemed the·
most lovely as wellas the most heroic of her sex. She was of a dark-
complexion (for in speaking of a lady, these trifles become im-
portant). Her teeth were of a pearly whiteness, and her large black
eyes sparkled with uncommon fire, tempered by the most attraCtive
sweetness. Her voice was strong and harmonious. Her manly un-
derstanding was strengthened and adorned by study. She was not
ignorant of the Latin tongue‚ but poffeffed in equal·perfe6tion the
Greek, the Syriae, and the Egyptian languages. She had drawn·
up for hcr own use an epitome of oriental history, and familiarly2
compared the beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the
sublime Longinus. .

This accomplished woman gave her hand to Odenathus, who from
a private station raised'himself to the dominion of the East. She
soon became the friend and companion of a hero. In the „intervals
of war, Odenathus paffionately delighted in the exercise- of hunt-
ing; he pursued with ardour the wild beasts of the desert, lions„
panthers‚ and bears3 and the ardour of Zenobia in that dangerous
amusement was not inferior to his own. She had inured her con-
stitution to fatigue, disdained the use of a covered carriage, gene-
rally appeared on horseback' in a military habit, and· sometimes
matched several miles on foot at the head of the troops. The suc-
cess of Odenathus was in a great measure ascribed to her incom-
