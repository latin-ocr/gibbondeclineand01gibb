OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

of Bithynia in the depth of winter. The season was severe and
tempestuous; great numbers of men as well as horses perished
in the snow3 and as the roads were broken up by inceffant rains,
he was obliged to leave behind him a confidcrable part of the
heavy baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced
marches. By this extraordinary effort of diligence, he arrived,
with a haraffed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian
Bosphorus, before the lieutenants of Licinius were apprised of his
hostile intentions. Byzantium surrendered to the power of Max-
imin‚ after a fiege of eleven days. He was detained some days
under the walls of Heraclea3 and he had no sooner taken poffeffion

to arms. The emperor of the East commanded a disciplined and
veteran army of above seventy thousand men, and Licinius, who
had collefited about thirty thousand Illyrians, was at first oppreffed

of his troops, restored the day, and obtained a decifive victory. The
incredible speed Which Maximin exerted in his ssight, is much more

Egypt. But he survived his misfortune only three or four months.
His death, which happened at Tarsus, was varioussy ascribed to despair,
to poison, and to the divinejustice. As Maximin was alike destitute
of abilities and of virtue, lie was lamentcd neither by the people nor

by the soldiers. The provinces of the East, delivered from the
