OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

and (to use the author’s metaphor) the blood circulated from the

extremities to the heart.

But all this well-laboured system of German antiquities is anni-
hilated by a single faet, too well attested to admit of any doubt,
and of too deeifive a nature to leave room for any reply. The Ger-
mans, in the age of Tacitus, were unacquainted with the use of let-
ters ‘⁶3 and the use of letters is the principal circumstance that distin-
guissies a civilized people from a herd of savages incapable of know-
ledge or refleffion. Without that artificial help, the human me-
mory soon diffipates or corrupts the ideas intrusted to her charge}
and the nobler faculties of the mind, no longer supplied with mo-
dels or with materials, gradually forget their powers; the judge-
. ment becomes feeble and lethargic, the imagination languid or irre-
gular. Fully to apprehend this important truth, let us attempt, in
an improved society, to calculate the immense distance between the
man of learning and the illiterate peasant. The former, by reading
and reflcffion, multiplies his own experience‚ and lives in distant
*ages and remote countries; whilst the latter, rooted to a single spot,
and confined to a few years of existence, surpaffes, but very little,
his fellow-labourer the ox in the exercise os his mental faculties.
The same, and even a greater, difference will be found between
nations than between individuals; and we may safely pronounce,
that without some species of wriffing, no people has ever preserved
the faithful annals of their history, ever made any considerable pro-
