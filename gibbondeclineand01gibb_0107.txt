OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

During a long period of two hundred and twenty years, from
the establilhment of this artful system to the death of Commodus,
the dangers inherent to a military government were, in a great
measure, suspended. The soldiers were seldom roused to that
fatal sense of their own strength, and of the weakness of the civil
authority, which was, before and afterwards, produCtive of such
drea-dful calamities. Caligula and Domitian were assaflinated in
their palace by their own domestics z the convulfions which agitated
Rome on the death of the former, were confined to the walls of the
city. But Nero involved the whole empire in his ruin. In the
space of eighteen months, four princes perilhed by the sword ; and
the Roman world was shaken by the fury of the contending armies·
Excepting only this short, though violent, eruption of military

unstained with civil blood, and undisturbed by revolutions. The
emperor was 61εᾶεά by the authority of the senate and the consent
qf the fhldiers ³⁹. The legions respeeted their oath of fidelity, and
it requires a minute inspeetion of the Roman annals to discover
three inconfiderable rebellionS, which were all suppressed in a few
months, and without even the hazard of a battle ³¹.

In elective momrchies, the vacancy of the throne is a moment
big with danger and mischief. The Roman emperors defirous to
spare the legions that interval of suspense, and the temptation of an
irregular choice, invested their defigned successor with so largea ssiare
of present power, as should enable him, after their decease, to
