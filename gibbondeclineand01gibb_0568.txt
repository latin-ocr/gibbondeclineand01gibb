heretics were, for the most part, averse to the pleasures of sense,
they morosely arraigned the polygamy of the patriarchs‚ the gal-

of murders, of executions, and of maffacres, which stain almost
every page of the Jewish anmals, they acknowledged that the bar-
barians of Palestine had exercised as much compaffion towards their
idolatrous enemies as they had ever shewn to their friends or
