OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

about fixty miles from Palmyra, when she was overtaken by the
pursuit of Aurelian’s light horse, seized, and brought back a captive
tome feet of the emperor. Her capital soon afterwards surrendered,
and was treated with unexpeeked- lenity. The arms, horses, and
camels, with an immense treasuvre of gold, filver, silk, and precious
stoneS, were all delivered to the conqueror, who leaving only a
garrison of fix hundred archers, returned to Emesa, and employed
