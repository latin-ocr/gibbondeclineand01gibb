vine knowledge, should disdain every form of worship except its
own, as impious and idolatrous. The rights of toleration were
held by mutual indulgence: they were justly forfeited by a re-
fusal of the accustomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute was
inflexibly refused by¹ the Jews, and by them alone, the confider-
ation os the treatment which they experienced from the Roman ma-
gistrates, will serve to explain how far these speculations are justified
by faCts, and will lead us to discover the true causes of the persecu· .
tion of Christianity.

Without repeating what has been already mentioned, of the
reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of
Jerusalem, we shall only obscrve, that the destruc'tion of the temple
and city was accompanied and followed by every circmstance that
could exasperate the minds of the conquerors‚ and authorize reli·-
gious persecution by the most specious arguments of political justice
and the public sasety. From the reign of Nero to that of Anto-
ninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion
os Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres
and insurrections. Humanity is ihocked at the recital of the hor-
rid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus,
and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with
the unsuspecting natives ¹5 and we are tempted to applaud the severe
retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a
