the feudal system ³² which has smee prevailed in Europe. But the
active victor, at the head of a numerous and disciplined army, visited
in person every province of Persia. The defeat of the boldest rebels,
and the reduction of the strongest fortifications ³³, diffused the terror
of his arms, and prepared the way for the peaceful reception of his
authority. An obstinate refistance was fatal to the chiefs; but their
followers vvere treated with lenity ³⁴. A cheerful submiffion was
rewarded with honours and riches; but the prudent Artaxerxes,
suffering no person except himself to assume the title os king, abo-
lished every intermediate power between the throne and the people.
His kingdom, nearly equal in extent to modern Pers1a, vvaS‚ on every

fide, bounded by the sea or by great rivers; by the Euphrates, the
Tigris, the Araxes, the Oxus, and the Indus, by the Caspian Sea,
and the Gulph of Persia ³³. That country was computed to contain in
the last century, five hundred and fifty-four cities, fixty thousand

villages‚ and about forty millions of souls ³⁶.

gestan defended their independence during
many years. As romances generally transport
to an ancient period the events of their own
time, it is not impossible, that the fabulous
exploits of Rustan prince of Segestam may
have been grafted on thi5 real history.

³⁵ W’e can scarcely attribute to the Persa-an
monarchy the sea-coast of Gedrofia or Macran,
which extends along the Indian Ocean from
Cape Jask (the promontory Capella) to Cape
Goadel. In the time os Alexander, and pro—

bably many ages afterwards, it was thinly in-
habited by a sax'age people of Icthyophagi,
or Filhermen, who knew no ans, who ac·
knowledgcd no master, and who were divided
by inhospitable deserts from the rest of the
world. (See Ari-ian dc Reb. IndiciS.) In
the twelfth century, the little town of Taiz,
(supposed by ΓΛ, Danville to be the Tefa of
Ptolemy) wass peopled and enriched by the
resort of the Arabian merchants. (See Geo-
graphie Nubiens, p. 58, and Dant-ille Geo-
graphie Ancienne‚ tom. ii. p. 383.) In the
last age the whole country was divided be-
tween three princes, one Mahometan and two
Idoln'teff, who maintained their independ-
ence against the *successors of Shaw Abbas-
(Voyages de Tavernier‚ part i. l. v. p. 635.)
