430 THE DECLINE AND FALL

,ς {nli P. protec'tion of some powerful chief, who acquired over their persons

hev—a and property, the same absolute rights as, among the Greeks and
Romans, a master exercised over his ssaves ¹²³. The greatest part
of the nation was gradually reduced into a state of servitude3 com-
pelled to perpetual labour on the estates of the Gallie nobles, and
confined to the soil, either by the real weight of fetters, or by the
no less cruel and forcible restraints-of the laws. During the long
series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of Gallienus
to that of Diocletian‚ the condition of these servile peasants was
peculiarly miserable; and they experienced at once the complicated

tyranny of their masters, of the barbarians, of the soldiers, and of
the officers of the revenue ¹⁹.
Their rebcl- Their patience was at last provoked into despair. On every fide
hon' they rose in muhstudes, armed with rustic weapons, and with ir-
refistible fury. The ploughman became a foot soldier, the shep-
herd mounted on horseback, the deserted villages and open towns
were abandoned to the flames, and the ravages of the peasants
equalled those of the fiercest barbarians ²⁰. They afferted the natural
rights of men, but they afferted those rights with the most savage
cruelty. The Gallie nobles justl‘y dreading their revenge, either
took refuge in the fortified cities, or fled from the wild scene of
anarchy. The peasants reigned without contr013 and two of theit·
’ most daring leaders had the folly and rashness-to affume the Im-
perial ornaments ²¹. Their power soon expired at the approach of
the legions. The strength of union and discipline obtained an easy
andebastise- vidior-y over a licentious and divided multitude ²². A severe re-
ment, taliation was inflidted on the peasants who were found in arms:
