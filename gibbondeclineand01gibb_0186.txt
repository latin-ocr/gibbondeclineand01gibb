found means to apprize him of the approaching danger. The em-
peror received the letters from Rome3 and as he was then engaged
in the conduct of a chariot race, he delivered thern unopened to the
Praetorian praefeci, direffing him to dispatch the ordinary affairs,
and to report the more important business that might be contained
in them. Macrinus read his fate, and resolved to prevent it. He
