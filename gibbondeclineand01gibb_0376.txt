straggled from the camp in quest of plunder, the king οι· general of
the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader should be appre-

precaution of Aurelian, who had exaered as hostages the sons and
daughters of the Gothic chiefs, contributed something to this pacific
temper. The youths he trained in the exereise of arms, and near his
own person; to the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman educatiom
and by bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers,
gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most
endearing connexions ²¹·

But the most important condition of peace was understood rather
than express'ed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces
from Dacia, and tacitly relinquished that *great province to the
Goths and Vandals ²². His manly judgement convinced him of the
sol-id advantages‚ and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace,
of thus contraffing the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian
subjeets, removed from those distant poffeffions which they were
unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and populousness to the
southern {ide of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the repe-
