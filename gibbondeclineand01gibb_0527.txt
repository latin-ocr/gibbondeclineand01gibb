to continue the operations of the siege, whilst, at the head of μ-ψῇα

those troops on whose valour and fidelity he more particularly de·-
pended, he advanced in person to engage the general of Maxen-
tius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in· two lines, according to
the usual praCtice of war3 but their experienced leader‚ perceiving
that the >numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own, suddenly
changed his disposition, and reducing the second, extended the front
of his first, line to a just proportion with that of the enemy. Such
evolutions‚ which only veteran troops can execute without con·
fusion in a moment of danger, commonly prove decifive: butas
this engagement began towards the close of the day, and was con-
tested with great obstinacy during the whole night, there was less
room for the conduct of the generalsthan for the courage of the sol-
diers. The return of light displayed the vidiory of Constantine,
and a field of carnage covered with many thousands of the van-
quished Italians. Their general Pompeianus was found among the
ssain3 Verona immediately surrendered at discretion, and the gar-

rison was made prisoners of war ⁵⁸. When the Officers of the vic-
torious army congratulated their master on this important success,
they ventured to add some respectful complaints, of such a nature,
however, as the most jealous monarchs will listen to without dis-
pleasure. They represented to Constantine, that, not contented
with performing all the duties of a commander, he had exposed his
own person with an excess of valour which almost degenerated into
rashness; and they conjured him for the future to pay more regard
to the preservation of a life, in which the safety of Rome and of

the empire was involved ⁵⁹. ἀ
