OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 59

in that of Romulus. The petty states of Latium were contained C HHA P.
within the metropolis of the empire, by whose superior influence h-vssd
they had been attracted. Those parts of Italy which have so long
languilhed under the lazy tyranny of priests and viceroys, had

- been afflic'ted only by the more tolerable calamities of war3 and

the first symptoms of decay, which they experienced‚ were amply
compensated by the rapid improvements of the Cisalpine Gaul.

The splendor of Verona may be traced in its remains: yet Verona

was- less celebrated than Aquileia or Padua‚ Milan or Ravenna.

II.iThe spirit of improvement had passed the Alps, and been felt Gaul and

even in the woods of Britain, which were gradually cleared away epam.
to open a free space for convenient and elegant habitatione. York
was the seat of government3 London was already enriched by com--
me1·ce; and Bath was celebrated for the salutary effeffits of its medi-
cinal waters. Gaul could boast of her twelve hundred cities 75; and
though, in the northern parts, many of them, without excepting
Paris itself‚ were little more than the rude and imperfect townships
of a rising people; the southern provinces imitated the wealth and
elegance of Italy ⁷⁶. Many were the cities of Gaul, Marseilles,
Aries, Nihnes, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Bourdeaux, Autun, Vienna,
Lyons, Langres, and Treves, whose ancient condition might sustain
an equal‚ and perhaps advantageous comparison with their present
state. With regard to Spain, that country'flourished as a province,
and has declined as a kingdom. Exhausted by the abuse of her
strength, by America, and by superstition, her pride might possibly
be confounded, if we required such a list of three hundred and

sixty cities, as Pliny has exhibited under the reign of Vespasian ⁷⁷.
