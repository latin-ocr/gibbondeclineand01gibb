most deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted
to investigate the antiquities of the Celts, the Scandinavians, and

paid to their important office, have been sussiciently illustrated.
But we cannot so easily express, or even conceive, the enthusiasm
of arms and glory, which they kindled in the breast of their au-

amusement of the fancy, than a passion of the soul. And yet, when
in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by Homer or

glow of martial ardour. But how faint, how eold is the sensation
which a peaceful mind can receive from solitar-y study ! It was in the

the glory of heroes of ancient days, the ancestors of those warlike

chieftains, who listened with transport to their artless but ani-
