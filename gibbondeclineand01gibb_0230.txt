rors were melted down and coined into money. These impious or-
ders could not be executed without tumults and maffacres, as in many
places the people chose rather to die in the defence of their altars,
than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the ra-
pine and cruelty of war. The soldiers themselves, among whom
this sacrilegious plunder was distributed, received it with a bluss13
and, hardened as they were in acts of violence, they dreaded the just
reproaches of their friends and relations. Throughout the Roman
world a general cry of indignation was heard, imploring vengeance
on the common enemy of human kind 3 and at length, by an a& of
private oppreffion, a peaeeful and unarmed province was driven into
rebellion against him ¹².

The procurator of Africa was a servant worthy of such a master,
who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as one* of
the most fruitful branches of the Imperial revenue. An iniquitous
sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that

concealed under their garments‚ and, by the assistance of their tu-
