remains of his patrimony. According to the rigour of law, the
emperor might have asserted his claim, and the prudent Atticus pre-
vented, by a frank confeffi0n‚ the officiousness'of informers. But
the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne, refused to accept
any part of it; and commanded him to use, without scruple‚ the‘

plaints, by requesting that he might be permitted to take upon
himself the whole additional expence ⁶⁸.

soon became a celebrated orator according to the useless rhetoric of
that age, which, confining itself to the schools, disdained to visit
either the Forum or the Senate. He was honoured with the con-
