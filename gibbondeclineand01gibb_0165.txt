Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a single city deserves
an honourable exception. As Byzantium was one of the greatest
passages from Europe into Afia, it had been provided with a strong
garris0n‚ and a fleet of five hundred veffels was anchored in the
harbour⁵³. The impetuofity of Severus disappointed this prudent
scheme of defence; he left to his generals the {iege of Byzantium,
forced the less guarded passage of the Hellespont, and, impatient of
a meaner enemy, preffed forward to encounter his rival. Byzantium,
attaeked by a numerous and increasmg army, and afterwards by the
whole naval power of the empire, sustained a siege of three years,
and remained faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The citi-
zens and soldiers (we know not from what cause) were animated with
eqnal fury3 several of the principal Officers of Niger, who despaired
of, or who disdained, a pardon, had thrown themselves into this last
refuge: the fortifications were esteemed Impregnable‚ and, in the de-
fence of the place, a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic
powers known to the ancients⁵⁴. Byzantium, at length, surrendered
to famine. The magistrates and soldiers were put to the sword, the
walls demoliffled, the privileges suppreffed, and the destined capital
of the east subfisted only as an open village, subje& to the insulting
jurisdiction of Perinthus. The historian Dion, who had admired
the flourilhing, and lamented the desolate, state of Byzantium, ae·
