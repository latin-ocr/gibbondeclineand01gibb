OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the Roman army received a total overthrow, which is attributed to
the rashness of Galerius, who, with an inconsiderable body of troops,

attacked the innumerable host of the Persians ⁶4. But the consider-
ation of the country that was the scene of action, may suggest ano-
ther reason for his defeat. The same ground on which Galerius

was vanquished‚ had been rendered memorable by the death of
Crassus, and the ssaughter of ten legions. It was a plain of more
than fixty miles, which extendcd from the hills of Carrhae to the
Euphrates 3 a smooth and barren furface of sandy desert, without a
hillock, without a tree‚ and without a spring of fresh water-⁶⁵. The

steady infantry of the Romans, sainting with heat and thirst, could⁴
v neither hope for victory if they preserved their ranks, nor break their
ranks without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger. In
this situation they were gradually encompaffecl by the superior num-
bem, haraffed by the rapid evolutions‚ and destroyed by the arrows of
the barbarian cavalry. The king of Armenia had fignalized his valour
in the battle, and acquired personal glory by the public misfortune.
He was pursued as far as the Euphrates; his horse was wounded, and·
it appeared impoffible for him to escape the νίξὶοῑὶουε enemy. In this
extreniity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which he saw before
him3 he dismounted and plunged into the stream. His armour was
heavy, the river very deep, and in those parts at least halfa mile in
breadth ⁶⁶3 yet such was his strength and dexterity‚ that he reached
in safety the opposite bank⁶⁷. With regard to the Roman gene·

ral, we are ignorant of the circumstances of his escape3 but when’
