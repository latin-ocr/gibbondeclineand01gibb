ἰιι what manner the most civilized provinces of Europe, Asia, k--v--r

and Africa, were united under the dominion of one sovereign,
and gradually connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of man-
ners, and of language. The Jews of Palestine‚ who had fondly
expected a temporal deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the rni-
racles of the divine prophet, that it was found unnecessary to
pubth, or at least to preserve, any Hebrew gospel ¹⁵². The au·
¹thentic histories of the aetions of Christ were composetl in the
Greek language, at a considerable distance from Jerusalem, and
after the Gentile converts were grown extremely numerous ¹⁵³.
As soon as those histories were transsated into the Latin tongue,
they were perfeffly intelligible to all the subjects of Rome, excepting
only to the0 peasants of Syria and Egypt, for whose benefit par-
ticular verfions were afterwards made. The public highways,
which had been construeted for the use of the legions, opened an
easy passage for the Christian miffionaries from Damascus to Corinth,
and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or Britain3 nor did those
spiritual conquerors encounter any of the obstacles which usually
setar-d or prevent the introduetion of a foreign religion into a
distant country. There is the strongest reason to believe, that be-

had been preached in every province, and in all the great cities of

the empire; but the foundation of the several congregationS, the Historia!
