paces. Yet when it was launched by a firm and skilful hand, there
was not any cavalry that durst venture within its reach, nor any
shield or corsset that could sustain the impetuofity of its weight. As
soon as the Roman had darted his pilum, he drew his sword, and
rushed forwards to close with the enemy. His sword was a {hortwell- ·
teinpered Spanish blade, that carried a double edge, and was alike
suited to the purpose of striking, or of pushing 3 but the soldierv was

body remained less exposed, whilst he infliC’ted a more dangerous

to a foor, or even nine inches. I have chosen
a medium.
