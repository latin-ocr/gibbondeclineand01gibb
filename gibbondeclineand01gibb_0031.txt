The golden eagle, which glittered in the front of the legion, was
the objedl: of theIr fondest devotion ; nor was it esteemed less impi-
ou8‚ than it was ignominious, to abandon that sacred enfign in the

hour of danger ³⁴.

These motives, which derived their strength
from the imagination, were enforced by fears and hopes of a more
substantial kind. Regular pay, occafional donatives, and a stated re-
compenoe, after the appointed term of service, alleviated the hard-
ships of the military life ³⁵, whilst, on the other hand, it was im-

generals had a right to punish with death ; and it was an inflexible
maxim of Roman discipline, that a good soldier should dread his
officers far more than the enemy. From such laudable arts did the
valour of the Imperial troops receive a degree of firmness and do-
cility, unattainable by the impetuous and irregular paffions of bar-
