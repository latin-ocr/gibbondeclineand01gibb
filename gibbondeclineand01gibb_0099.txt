OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 81
When all the various powers of executive government were C {111²} Ρ·
committed to the Imperial nmgssrate, the ordinary magistrates of TW

the commonwealth languished in obscurity‚ without vigour‚ and uate>-
almost without business. The names and forms of the ancient

administration were preserved by Augustus with the most anxious

care. The usual number of consuls, praetorS, and tribunes ¹⁵, were
annually invested with their respective enfigns of office, and con-
tinued to discharge some of their least important functions. Those
honours still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans, and the
emperors themselves, though invested for life with the powers of the
consulship, frequently aspired to the title of that annual dignity‚
which ,they condescended to share with the most illustrious of their
fellow-citizens ¹⁶. In the electiori of these magistrates, the people‚
during the reign of Augustus, were permitted to expose all the in·-
conveniencies of a wild democracy. That artful prince‚ instead of
discovering the least symptom of impatience, humbly solicited their
suffrages for himself or his friends, and scrupuloussy practised all
the duties of an ordinary candidate¹⁷. But we may venture to
ascribe to his councils, the first measure of the succeeding reign, by

which the eledtions were transferred to the senate ¹²³. The as-
¹⁵ Two consuls were created on the Ca-

lends of January; but in the course of the
year others were substituted in their places,

of the consulship. The virtuous princes were

moderate in the pursuit, and exa& in the dis-
charge of it. Trajan revived the ancient

till the annual number seems to have amount-
ed to no less than twelve. The praetors were
usually sixteen or eighteen (Lipsius in Excurs.
D. ad Tacit. Annal. 1. i.). 1 have not men-
tioned the AEdiles or Qaestors. Officers of
the police or revenue easily adapt themselves
to any form of government. In the time of
Nero, the tribunes legally poss'cfl'cd the right
of interceffi‘on, though it might be dangcrous
to exercise it (Tacit. Annal. xvi. zm. In
Δ the time of Trajan, it was doubtful whether
the tribuneship was an office or a name (Prin.
Epist. i. ²3·)'

that he would observe the laws (Plin. Pane-
gyric. c. 64).

¹⁷ Qoties Magistratuum Comitiis interes-
set, Tribus cum candidatis suis circuibat:
supplicabatque more solemni. Ferebat et ipse
suffragium in tribubus, ut unus e populor
Suetonius in August. c. 56.

¹³ Tum primum Comitia e campo ad pa-
tres transsata sunt. Tacit. Anna]⁴ i. ⁵5· The
word primum seems to allude to some faint
and unsuccessful efforts, which were made to-
ward: restoring them to the pcople.
