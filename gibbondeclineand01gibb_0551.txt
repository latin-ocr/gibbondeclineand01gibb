was much less exposed to the danger of famine than the a'rmy of
the· befiegers. The naval commanders of Constantine were sum-
moned 'to his camp, and received his positive orders to force the
passage of the Hellespont‚ as the fleet of Licinius, instead of secking
and destroying their feeble enemy, continued inaffive in those nar-

advantage. Crispus, the emperor-’s eldest son, was intrusted with
the execution of this daring enterprise‚'whieh he performed with
so much courage and succest, that he deserved the esteem‚ and most
probably excited the jealousy, of his father. The engagement

fieets‚ after a considerable and mutual loss, retired into their
respective harbours of Europe and Asia. The second 'day about
