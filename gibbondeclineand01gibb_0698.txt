parties. The Pagans were incensed at the rashness of a recent and

κ--ψ--Ι obscure seer, which presumed to accuse their countrymen of error,

and to devote their ancestors to eternal misery. The habits of justi-
fying the popular mythology against the invectives of an impla· Β
cable enemy, produced in their minds some sentiments of faith and
reverence for a system which they had been accustomcd to confidet
with the most careless levity. The supernatural powers affumed by
the church inspired at the same time terror and emulation. The
followers of the established religion intrenched themselves behind a
similar fortification of prodigies3 invented new modes of sacrifice,
of expiation, and of :initiation ¹³⁶5 attempted to revive the credit of
their expiring oracles ¹³⁷5 and listened with eager credulity to every
impostor, who flattered -their prejudices by a tale of wonders ¹³⁸.
Both parties seemed to acknowledge the truth of those miracles
which were claimed by their adversaries3 and while they were con-
tented with ascribing thern to the arts of magie‚ and to the power
of daemons, they mutually concurred in restoring and establishing
the reign of superstition ¹³⁹. Philosophy, her most dangcrous ene-
my, was now converted into her most useful ally. The groves of

the academy, the gardens of Epicurus, and even the portico of the

ber of instances‚ the mysterious worship of

and Aristeas3 the cures performed at the

Myrhrae, and the Tauroboliag the latterof
which became fashionable in the time of the
Antonines (See a Diss'ertation of M. de Boze,
in the Memoires de l'Academie des Inscrip-
tlen‘, tom. ii. p.443.). The romance of
Apuleius is as full of devotion as of satire.

¹³⁷ The impostor Alexander ver>¹ strongly
recommended the oracle of Trophonius at
Mallos, and those of Apollo, at Claros and
Miletus (Luciam, commi. p. 236. Edit. Reitz).
The lull· of these, whose singular-historywould
surnifn a very curicus episode, was conl'ultezl
by Diocletian before he publ-ithed his edifts

stix-ine of AEsculapiuS, and the fables related
of Apollonius of Tyana, were frequently op-
posed to the miracles of Christ3 though 1
agree with Dr. Lardner (see Testimonies, vol.
iii. p. 2 ς z. 352), that when Philostratus com-
posed the life of Apollonius, he had no such
intention.

¹³9 It is serioussy to be lamented‚ that the
Christian fathers, by acknowledging the su-
pernatur-al, or, as they deem it, the infernal,
part of Paganism, destroy with their own
hands the great advantage which we might
etherii-ise derive from the liberal conceffions
ci cur adversaries. ι
