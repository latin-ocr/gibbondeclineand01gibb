OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

It was scarcely possible that the eyes of contemporaries should
discover in the public felicity the latent causes of decay and cor-
ruption. This long peace, and the uniform government of the
Romans, introduced a ssow and secret poison into the vitals of the
empire. The minds of men were gradually reduced to the same
level, the fire of genius was extinguished, and even the military
spirit evaporated. The natives of Europe were brave and robust.
Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum supplied the legions with ex-
cellent soldiers, and constituted the real strength of the monarchy.
The'rr personal valour remained, but they no longer poffess'ed that
public courage which is nourished by the love of independence, the
sense of national honour, the presence of danger, and the habit of
command. They received laws and governors from the will of
their sovereign‚ and trusted for their defence to a mercenary army.
The posterity of their boldest leaders was contented with the rank
of citizens aud subjeets. The most aspiring spirits resorted to the
court or standard of the emperors; and the deserted provinces, de-
prived of political strength or rinion, insenfibly sunk into the languid
indifference of private life.

The love of letters, almost inseparable from peace and re-
finement, was fathionable among the subje&s of Hadrian and
the Antonines‚ who were themselves men of learning and cu-
riosity. It was diffused over the whole extent of theIr em-
pire3 the most northern tribes of Britons had acquired a taste for
rhetoric: Homer as well as Virgil were transcribed and studied on
the banks of the Rhine and Danube3 and the most liberal rewards
fought out the faintest glimmerings of literary merit¹¹⁰. The
