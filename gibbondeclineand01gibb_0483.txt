OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

splendour and luxury would subdue the imagination of the multi-
tude; that the monarch would· be less exposed to the rude license
of the people and the soldiers‚ as his person was secluded from the
public view3 and that habits of submiffion would insensibly be pro-
duffive of sentiments of veneration. Like the modesty affected
by Augustus, the state maintained by Diocletian was a theatrical
representation3 but it must be confeffed‚ that of the two comedies‚
the former was of a much more liberal and manly charaeta than the
latter. It was the aim of the one to disguise‚ and the objeec of the
other to display, the unbounded power which the emperors poffeffed
over the Roman world.

Ostentation was the first principle of the new system instituted by
Diocletian. The second was divifion. He divided the empire, the
provinces, and every bran-ch of the civil as well as military admi-
nistration. He multiplied the wheels of the machine of govern-
ment, and rendered its operations less rapid but more secure.
Whatever advantages‚ and whatever defects might attend these
innovations, they must be ascribed in a very great degree to the
first invent0r; but as the new frame of policy was gradually
improved and completed by succeeding princes, it will be more
satisfaftory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full
'maturity and perfeffion ¹⁰³. Reserving, therefore, for the reign of
Constantine a more exa& pidiure of the new empire, we shall con-
tent ourselves with deseribing the principal and decisive outline, as*

it was traced by the hand of Diocletian. He had associated three-

colleagues in the exercisc of the supreme power; and as he was
convinced that the abilities of a single man were inadequate to the
public defence, he considered the joint administration of four princes
