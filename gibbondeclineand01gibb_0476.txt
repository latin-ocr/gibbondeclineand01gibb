dillinclion of a less honourable kind. It was the last that Rome
ever beheld. Soon after this period, the emperors ceased to vanquish,
and Rome ceased to be the capital of the empire.

by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles. The presence
of some god, or the mernory of some hero, seemed to animate
every part of the city, and the empire of the world had been
