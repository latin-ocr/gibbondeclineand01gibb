OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Armenia ⁵², and the long tra& of mountainous country, in which
the Persian cavalry was of little service, opened a secure entrance
into the heart of Media, to the second of the Roman armies. These
brave troops laid waste the adjacent provinces, and by several succeff-
ful adtions against Artaxerxes, gave a faint colour to the emperor’s
vanity. But the retreat of this vidiorious army was imprudent,
or at least unfortunate. ln repaffing the mountains, great numbers
of soldiers perished by the badness of the roads and the severity

counsels, and perhaps by his own fears, deserted the bravest troops
and the fairest prospe& of vi&ory; and after consuming in Meso-
potamia an inaetive and inglorious summer, he led back to Antioch
an army diminished by fickness, and provoked by disappointment.
The behaviour of Artaxerxes had been very different. F lying with>

sions that⁴ followed that emperor's death, presented themselves in

vain to his ambition. Instead of expelling the Romans, as
he pretended‚ from the continent of Asia, he fou-nd himself
