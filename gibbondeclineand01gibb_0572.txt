seen by the primitive Christians in a much more odious and formid-

pit, were still permitted to roam upon earth, to torment the bodies,
and to seduce the munds, of finful men. The daemons soon discovered
and abused the natural propenfity of the human heart towards
devotion, and, artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from
their Creator, they usurped the place and honours of the Supreme
Deity. By the success of their malicious confflvances, they at once
gratified their own vanity and revenge, and obtained the only
comfort of which they were yet susce'ptible, the hope of involving
the human species in the participation of their guilt and misery.

another of AEstulapius, a third of Venus, and a fourth perhaps of
Apollo ³⁹ 3 and that, by the advantage of their long experience and„
aerial nature, they were enabled to execute, with sufficient sszill and
