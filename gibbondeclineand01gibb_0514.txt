undivided power. Maxentius conlidered himself as the legal
sovereign of Italy, elected by the Roman senate and people3 nor
would ‘he endure the control of his father, who arrogantly de-
elared,2.that by his name and abilities the rash youth had been
established on the throne. 'The cause was solemnly pleaded before
the Praetorian guards, and those troops, who dreaded the severity of
the old emperor, espoused the party of Maxentius ³². The life and
freedor‘n of Maxi-mian were however respected, and he retired from
Italy into Illyricum, affecting to lament his past conduct, and secretly
contriving new mischiefs. But Galerius, who was well acquainted
with his character, soon obliged him to leave his dominions, and
the last refuge of the disappointed Maximian was the court of his
son-in-Iaw Constantine ³³. He was received with respect by that
artful prime, -and with the appearance of filial tenderness by the
emprefs Fausta. That he might remove every suspicion, he re·-
figned the Imperial purple a second time ³⁴, profeffing himself at
length convinced of the vanity of greatness and amb‘ition. Had
he persevered in this resolution, he might¹ have ended his life with
less dignity indeed than in his first retirement, yet, however, with
comfort and reputation. But the near prospe& of a throne brought
back to his remembrance the state from whence he was fallen, and

he resolved, by a desperate effort, either to reign or to perish.
