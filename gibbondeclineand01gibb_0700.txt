tious prejudices of soldiers and peasants. In the general admini-
stration of the provinces they obeyed the laws which their bene-
faffitor had established3 but they frequently found occasions of exer-
cising within their camp and palaces a secret persecution ¹⁴4, for
which the imprudent zeal of the Christians sometimes offered the
most specious pretences. A sentence of death was executed upon

“ Maximilimus, an African youth, who had been produced by his own

father before the magistrate as a sufficient and legal recruit‚ but
who obstinately perfisted in declaring, ,that his conscience would not
permit him to embrace the profeffion of a soldier ¹⁴⁵. It could
scarcely be expeffilaed that any government should suffer the astion
of Marcellus the Centurion to pass with impunity. On the day of
a public festival, that officer threw away his belt‚ his arms, and the
enfigns of his office, and exclaimed with a loud voice, that he would
obey none but Jesus Christ the eternal'King, and that he renounced
for ever the use of carnal we‘apons‚ and the service of an idolatrous
master. The soldiers, as soon as they recovered from thei-r asto-
niffiment, secured the person of Marcellus. He was examined'in
the city of Tingi by the president of that part of Mauritania3 and

as he was convicted by his own confession, he was condemned and
beheaded for the crime of desertion ¹4⁶. Examples of such a nature,

favour much less of religious persecution than of martial or even
