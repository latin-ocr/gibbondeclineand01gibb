OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

In this ghueral view of the persecuti0n‚ which was first authorized
by the ediCts of Diocleum, I have purposely refrained from describ-
ing the particular sufferings and deaths of the Christian martyrs. It
would have been an easy talk, from the history of Eusebius, from
the declamations of Lactantius, and from the most ancient acts, to
collect a long series of horrid and disgustful pictures„ and to fill
many pages with racks and scourges, with iron hooks, and red hot
beds, and with all the variety of tortures which fire and steel‚ savage
beasts and more savage executionem, could inflict on the humau-
body. These melancholy scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of

vifions and miracles destined either to delay the death, to celebrate
the triumph, or to discover the relies, of those canonized saints who

suffered for the name of Christ. ButI cannot determine what I ought
to transcribe, till I am satisfied how much I ought to believe. The
gravest ofthe ecclefiastical historians, Eusebius himself, indireffly con-
sesses, that he has related whatever might redound to the glory, and
that he has suppreffed all that could tend to the disgrace‚ of reli·

that a writer who has so openly -violated one of the fundamental
laws of history, has not paid a very stri& regard to the observance
of the other: and the suspicion will derive additional credit from
the character of Eusebius, which was less tinctured with credulity‚
and more praCtised in the arts of courts, than that of almost any
of his contemporaries. On some particular occasions, when the ma-
‘gistrates were exasperated by some-personat motives of interest or
