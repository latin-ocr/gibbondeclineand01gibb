THE DECLINE AND FALL

But the most important· service which Probus rendered to the re-

fince the death of Aurelian, had ravaged that great province with
impunity ³⁴. Among the various multitude of those fierce invaders,
We may distinguish, with some degree of clearness, three great armies,
or rather namus, succeffively vanquissied by the valour of Probus.
He drove back the Franks into their moraffes3 a descriptive cir-
cumstance from whence we may infer, that the confederacy known
by the manly appellation of Free, already occupied the flat maritime
country, interseeted and almost overflown by the stagnating waters
of the Rhine, and that several tribes of the Frifians and Batavians
had aeceded to their alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a ”
considerable people of the Vandalic race. They had wandered in
quest of booty from the banks ,οἱ the Oder to those of the Seine.
They esteemed themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the
restitution of all their booty, the permiffion of an undisturbed retreat.
They attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their punish-
ment was immediate and terrible ³⁵. But of all the invaders of Gaul,
the most formidable were the Lygians, a distant people who reigned
over a wide domain on the, frontiers of Poland and Silefia ³⁶. In-
the Lygian mitiori, the Arii held the first rank by their numbers
and fierceness. “ The Arii (it is thus that they are described by the
‘⁴ energy of Tacitus) study to improve by art and circumstances the
