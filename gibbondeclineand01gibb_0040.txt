'THE DECLINE AND FALL

The navy maintained by the emperors might seem inadequate to

k-vz-——t their greatness3 but it was fully sufficient for every useful purpose

of government. The ambition of the Romans was confined to the
land3 nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the enter-
prising spirit which had prompted the navigators of Tyre, of Car-
thage, and exten of Marseilles, to enlarge the bounds of the world,
and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean. To the Romans
the ocean remained an object of terror rather than of curiofity ⁶⁶;
the whole extent of the Mediterranean, after the destruetion ofCar-
mage, and the extirpation of the pirates, was included within their
provinces. The policy of the emperors was directed only to pre-
serve the peaceful dominion of that sea, and to prote& the com-
merce of their subjefits. With these moderate views, Augustus
stationed two permanent fieets in the most convenient ports ⁴of
Italy, the one at Ravenna, on the Adriatic, the other at Misenum,
in the bay of Naples. Experience seems at length to have con-
vinced the afficiente, that as soon as their gallies exceeded two, or
at the most three‘ranks of oars, they were suited rather for vain
pomp than for real service. Augustus himself, in the vidtory of
Aetium, had seen the superiority of his own light frigates (they
were called Liburnians) o'ver the lofty but unwieldy castles of his
rival ⁶⁷. Of these Liburnians he composed the two fleets of Ra-
venna and Misenum, destined to command, the one the eastern,
the other the western division of the Mediterranean3 and to each
of the squadrons he attached a body of several thousand marines.
Befides these two ports, which may be confidered as the princi-
pal‘seats of the Roman navy, a very confiderable force was sta-
