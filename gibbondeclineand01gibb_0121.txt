OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Marcus was the only man in the empire who seemed ignorant or
insenfible of the irregularities of Faustina3 which, according to
the prejudices of every age, reflee‘ted some disgrace on the injured
husband. He promoted several of her lovers to posts of honour and
profit ³, and during a connexion of thirty years, invariably gave
her proofs of the most tendcr confidence‚ and of a respetst which
ended not with her life. In his Meditations, he thanks the gods,
who had bestowed on him a wife, so faithful, so gentle, and of
such a wonderful simplicity of manners ⁴. The obsequious senate,
at his earnest request, declared her a goddess. She was represented
in her temples, with the attributes of Juno,-Venus, and Ceres3
and it was decreed, that, on the day of their nuptiale, the youth of

either sex ssiould pay their vows before the altar of their chaste
patroness ⁵.

The monstrous vices of the son have cast a {hade on the purity
of the father’s virtues. lt has been obje&ed to Marcus, that he
sacrificed the happiness of millions to a fond partiality for a worth-
less boy; and that he chose a succeffor in his own family, rather
than in the republic. Nothing, however, was neglected by the
anxious father, and by the men of virtue and learning whom he
summoned to-his affistance, to expand the narrow mind of young
Commodus, to corre& his growing vices, and to render him wor-
thy of the throne, for which he was designed. But the power of
instruetion is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy
dispofitions where it is almost superfluous. ‚The distasteful leffon of
a grave philosopher was, in a moment, obliterated by the whisper of
a profligate favourite3 and Marcus himself blasted the fruits of this
