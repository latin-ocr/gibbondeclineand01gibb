45² THE DECLINE AND FALL

cerely desirous of peace, to negociate with the greater weight and
dignity. Three persons only affisted at this important conference,
the minister Apharban‚ the praefe& of the guards, and an officer

condition proposed by the ambaffador, is not at present of a very
intelligible nature3 that the city of Nifibis might be established
for the place of mutual exchange, or, as we should formerly have

is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of⁷the Roman princes,
to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but
as Nisibis was situated within their own dominions, and as they were
masters both of the imports and exports, it should seem, that
such restraints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a
foreign treaty. To render them more effedwal, some stipulations
were probably required on the fide of the king of Persia, which
appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity, that
Narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them. As this was the
only article to which he refused his consent, it was no longer in-
sifled on3 and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in
its natural channels‚ or contented themselves with such restriCtions3
as it depended on their own authority to establish,
