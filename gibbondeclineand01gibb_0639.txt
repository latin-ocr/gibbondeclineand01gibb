OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

event, which ought to have excited the wonder, the curiosity, and
the devotion of mankind, pafl'cd without notice in an age of science
and history ¹⁹⁶. It happened during the lifetime of Seneca aud the
elder Pliny, who must have experienced the immediate effens, or
received the earliest iutelligence‚ of the prodigy. Each of these phi-
losophers, in a laborious work, has recorded all the great pheno-
·mena of Nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets, and eclipses, which
his indefatigable curiosity could colle&¹⁹⁷. Both the one and the
other have omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to which the
mortal eye has been witness fince the creation of the globe. A dis-

tin& chapter of Pliny '⁹³ is defigned for eclipses of an extraordinary
nature and unusual durati0n3 but he contents himself with de-
scribing the singular defeet of light which followed the murder of
Caesar, when, during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the sun
appeared pale and without splendour. This season of obscurity,
which cannot surely be compared with the praeternatural darkness of
-the Paffion, had been already celebrated by most of the poets '⁹⁹ and

historians of that memorable age ²⁰⁰.

¹9⁶ The celebrated pafl'age of Phlegon is
now wisely abandoned. When Tertullian
affures the Pagans, that the mention of the
prodigy is found in Arcanis (not Archivis)
vestris, (see his Apology, c. 21.) he probabjy
appeals to the Sibylline verses, which relate
it exac'tly in the words of the Gospel.
