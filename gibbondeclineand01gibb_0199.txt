OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

interrupted by the care of the earth. In the second rank that ami-
able prince soon acquired the affections of the public, and excited
the tyrant’s jealousy‚ who resolvcd to terminate the dangerous com—
petition, either by corrupting the manners, or by taking away the
life, of his rival. His arts proved unsuccessful; his vain defigns were
constantly discovered by his own loquacious foHy, and disappointcd
by those virtuous and faithful servants whom the prudence of Mamaea
had placed about the person of her son. In a hasty sally of passion,
Elagabalus resolved to execute by force what he had been unable to

been murdered, infiamed their paffions into fury, and the tempest of
the camp could only be appeal'cd by the presence and authority of
the popular youth. Provoked at this new instance of their affection
