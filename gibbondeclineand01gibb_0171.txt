OF THE ROMAN ΕΜΡΙΗΕΤ

the celebrated Papinian, was appointed to execute the motley office
of Praetorian praese&

Till the reign of Severus, the virtue and even the good sense of
the emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affcfted reve-
rence for the senate, and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil
policy instituted by Augustus. But the youth of Severus had been
trained in the implicit obedience of camps, and his riper years spent
in the despotisrn of military command. His haughty and inflexible
spirit could not discover, or would not acknowledge, the advantage
of preserving an intermediate power, however imaginary‚ between
the emperor and the army. He disdained to profess himself the
servant of an affembly that detested his person and trembled at
his frown; he iffued his commanda, where his request would have
proved as effectual ; affumed the conduct and style of a sovereign and
a conqueror, and exercised, without disguise, the whole legissative
as well as the executive power.

The vietory over the senate was easy and inglorious. Every eye
and every paffion were directed to the supreme magistrate, who pos-

seffed the arms and treasure of the state; whilst the senate, neither ⁷

elested by the people, nor guarded by military force, nor ani-
mated by public spirit, rested its declining authority on the frail and
crumbling bafis of ancient opinion. The fine theory of a repub-
lic insenfibly vansshed, and made way for the more natural and sub-

stantial feelings of monarchy. As the freedom and honours of Rome
were successively communicated to the provinces, in which the old
government had been either unknown, or was remembered with
abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually obli-
terated. The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines ⁷⁰ ob-
serve‚ with a malicious pleasure, that although the sovereign of Rome,
