OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

so long disputed with each other the titulat primacy of Asia ²³³. The
capitals of Syria and Egypt held a still superior rank in the empire:
Antioch and Alexandria looked down with disdain on a crowd of
dependent cities⁸4‚ and yielded, with reluctanee, to the majesty of
Rome itself.

All these cities were connected with each other, and with the
capital by the public highwayS, which iffuing from the Forum of
Rome, traversed Italy, pervaded the provinces, and were termi-
nated only by the frontiers of the empire. If we carefully trace
the distance from the wall of Antoninus to Rome, and from thence
to Jerusalem, it will be found that the great chain of communi-
cation, from the north-west to the south-east point of the empne,

was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty Roman
miles ⁸⁵. The public roads were accurately divided by mile-stones,
and ran in a dire& line from one city to another, with very little
respe& for the obstacles either of nature or private property.
NIountains were perforated, and bold arches thrown over the broad-

est and most rapid streams⁸⁶. The middle part of the road was

raised into a terrace which commanded the adjacent country, con-
fisted of several strata of sand, graveL and cement‚ and was
paved with large stones, or in some places, near the capital, with

commend concord to the rival cities.

Β* The inhabitants of Egypt, exclusive of
Alexandria, amounted to seven millions and
a half (Joseph. de Bell. Jud. ii. 16.). Under
the military government of the Mamalukes‚
Syria was supposed to contain fixty thousand
villages. (Histoire de TimurBec, 1. v. c. 20.)
